Use Mozilla (or IE :D ) for opening the xml file. Chrome has security restrictions for local files. 
I have created the xml with c# code. You can safely delete the xml file and create it again after running the code.
There is no validation of the data in the classes, I know :)
There is no validation in the creation of the elements in the xml either. :)
