1
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:17,686
Freud said, "love and work.
Work and love.

2
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:19,322
That's all there is."

3
00:01:19,323 --> 00:01:22,292
Well, I'm retired,
and my wife is dead.

4
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:26,463
As you can imagine, that's
given me some time on my hands.

5
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:28,598
My wife's been gone
for three and a half years.

6
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,800
I miss her in every way.
And retirement?

7
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:33,903
That is an ongoing,
relentless effort in creativity.

8
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:36,672
At first, I admit
I enjoyed the novelty of it.

9
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,308
Sort of felt like
I was playing hooky.

10
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:42,012
I used all the miles I'd saved
and traveled the globe.

11
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:44,446
The problem was, no matter where
I went, as soon as I got home,

12
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:47,183
the nowhere-to-be thing
hit me like a ton of bricks.

13
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:50,353
I realized the key to this whole
deal was to keep moving.

14
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:53,323
Get up, get out of the house,
and go somewhere.

15
00:01:53,324 --> 00:01:55,291
Anywhere.

16
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:58,696
Come rain or shine,
I'm at my Starbucks by 7:15.

17
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:01,597
Excuse me,
mind if we join you?

18
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:03,199
- No.
- Hey. How are you?

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,836
Can't explain it, but it makes
me feel part of something.

20
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,704
These guys today,
they're not numbers guys.

21
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:09,972
Don't talk figures
with them.

22
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:11,341
How do I spend
the rest of my days?

23
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:15,312
You name it.
Golf, books, movies, pinochle.

24
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:16,746
Tried yoga, learned to cook,

25
00:02:16,747 --> 00:02:19,082
bought some plants,
took classes in Mandarin.

26
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,851
Xiang xin wo,
wo shen me dou shiguo le.

27
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:24,454
Translation... "believe me,
I've tried everything."

28
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:28,926
And then, of course,
there are the funerals.

29
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:35,031
So many more
than I could imagine.

30
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:37,199
The only traveling I do
these days

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,837
is out to San Diego
to visit my son and his family.

32
00:02:40,838 --> 00:02:43,372
They're great.
I love them to pieces.

33
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,708
But to be honest, I think
I probably relied on them

34
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,443
way more than I should.

35
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:50,279
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not an unhappy person.

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,781
Quite the contrary.

37
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:56,653
I just know there's a hole in
my life, and I need to fill it.

38
00:02:56,654 --> 00:02:58,621
Soon.

39
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:02,458
Which brings me to today
when I was leaving the market

40
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,329
and caught your flyer
out of the corner of my eye.

41
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,932
Hmm.

42
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,835
"Seniors, be an intern."

43
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:13,970
Ben,
I thought that was you.

44
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:14,971
Hi.

45
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:15,705
Hey.

46
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:17,340
What'd you find?

47
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:20,209
I think an Internet place
is looking for senior interns.

48
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,178
- Am I reading this right?
- Let me see.

49
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:25,381
"Applicants must be
over 65 years of age...

50
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:28,884
Have organizational skills, a
genuine interest in e-commerce,"

51
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,153
whatever that is...

52
00:03:30,154 --> 00:03:32,154
"...and a roll-up-your-sleeves
attitude."

53
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:35,225
Aboutthefit. Com, isn't that
the outfit that was...

54
00:03:35,226 --> 00:03:36,392
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:03:36,393 --> 00:03:38,561
They bought one of those
old factories in red hook.

56
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:41,230
My daughter says they
sell clothes on the Internet.

57
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:43,366
How that works,
I have no idea.

58
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,935
Well, you have to
upload the application.

59
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:48,004
That could be challenging.
Listen to this...

60
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,139
"cover letters
are so old-fashioned.

61
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,542
Show us who you are
with a cover-letter video.

62
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:56,012
Upload your video
to Youtube or Vimeo using

63
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:59,949
.MOV, .AVI,
or a .MPG file.

64
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,018
We look forward to
meeting you."

65
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:03,419
Well,
I guess that's meeting me.

66
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,755
I swear I don't even know
what language that was.

67
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,925
What are you doing tonight,
Ben?

68
00:04:08,926 --> 00:04:11,127
- A frozen lasagna?
- Well...

69
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:14,263
I could make a little salad,
turn it into a dinner for two,

70
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:17,400
like we did that time
and never did again.

71
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,402
You know that was
over five months ago?

72
00:04:19,403 --> 00:04:22,071
Oh, yeah. No, no, we got to
do that again, for sure,

73
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:24,073
but okay
if we take a rain check?

74
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:25,775
You're awful cute,
you know that?

75
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,810
- No, I didn't.
- Well, it's true, you are.

76
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:29,480
So I'll see you.

77
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:33,783
Don't take too long,
doll.

78
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:35,818
You're not
getting any younger.

79
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:38,821
- I know, I know, I know.
- All right.

80
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:03,413
So here I am, applying to be
one of your interns

81
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:05,214
because the more
I think about this idea,

82
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:07,216
the more tremendous
I think it is.

83
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:09,919
I love the idea of having
a place I can go every day.

84
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,954
I want the connection,
the excitement.

85
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:13,256
I want to be challenged,

86
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:15,625
and I guess I might even
want to be needed.

87
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:18,061
The tech stuff might
take a bit to figure out.

88
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:19,795
I had to call
my 9-year-old grandson

89
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:22,332
just to find out
what a USB connector was.

90
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,266
But I'll get there.
Eager to learn.

91
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:27,536
Also, I want you to know I've
been a company man all my life.

92
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,639
I'm loyal, I'm trustworthy,
and I'm good in a crisis.

93
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,408
And I love that
you're right here in Brooklyn.

94
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,343
I've lived here all my life,
and lately I feel

95
00:05:34,344 --> 00:05:36,178
I may not be hip enough
to live in Brooklyn,

96
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:38,448
so this could help with that,
too.

97
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,683
I read once,
musicians don't retire.

98
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:42,919
They stop when
there's no more music in them.

99
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,256
Well, I still have music in me,
absolutely positive about that.

Good news,
I found a size eight in Navy.

117
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:22,058
No, you are right. That package
should have arrived by now.

118
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,426
Let me
track that for you.

119
00:06:23,427 --> 00:06:25,594
Yep, these pants are awesome
if you have hips.

120
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:26,896
Super slimming.

121
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:29,031
Okay, let me just
review this with you...

122
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:30,767
you have six bridesmaids.
You ordered six

123
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:32,935
of the silk chiffon
antoinette dresses in pink.

124
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,503
The wedding
is in three days,

125
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:38,373
and the dresses just arrived
all in charcoal gray.

126
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:42,144
Which we don't even sell,
so that is a bit of a mystery.

127
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:43,879
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do about this.

128
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,282
I am gonna call the vendor
and have this fixed today.

129
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:48,751
I will personally see the
dresses before they are Fedexed.

130
00:06:48,752 --> 00:06:50,920
And I promise you
they will be at your front door

131
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,855
by 9:00 A.M. Friday,
okay?

132
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:54,690
You know what, let me give you
my cell, just in case...

133
00:06:54,691 --> 00:06:57,626
718-555-0199.

134
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,661
Oh, thank you so much
for your patience.

135
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:02,031
And I am gonna refund you back
all your money.

136
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,299
It's the...

137
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,835
yes. N...

138
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:09,038
okay, hey, you check this one
off your list, okay?

139
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,272
This is done.

140
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:13,409
And, Rachel,
have a great wedding.

141
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,544
Oh, my God,
how did that happen?

142
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:16,613
Jules?

143
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:18,080
I know, I know,
I'm late for something.

144
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:19,382
Yeah, everything.

145
00:07:19,383 --> 00:07:20,984
You see why I take
customer-service calls?

146
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:22,485
I mean, it's so good.
You learn so much.

147
00:07:22,486 --> 00:07:24,253
Okay, what's up?
What am I doing?

148
00:07:24,254 --> 00:07:26,121
Okay, Cameron was waiting for
you but had another meeting.

149
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:27,890
He said
he'll be back at 2:00.

150
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,493
- Everyone needs you to sign off on tomorrow's homepage.
- Right.

151
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,362
And your 11:00 is in
the big conference room.

152
00:07:32,363 --> 00:07:34,630
So is your 11:10.
Finance needs you,

153
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:36,231
and I guess you
e-mailed a bunch of people

154
00:07:36,232 --> 00:07:37,433
at 4:00 A.M.
about something?

155
00:07:37,434 --> 00:07:39,202
Oh, good,
I forgot about that.

156
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:41,170
I want to figure out a way for
friends to shop together online.

157
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:42,704
Make it less of
an alone thing.

158
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:45,042
- E-mail me that idea, will you?
- Yeah, I like that.

159
00:07:45,043 --> 00:07:46,775
Um, is now a good time
to call your Mom back?

160
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:47,910
Dude, I'm on a bike.

161
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:50,246
Happy birthday!

162
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:51,647
Come on.

163
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:54,250
Oh.

164
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:56,920
Oh, what a mess. This is
the middle of the office.

165
00:07:56,921 --> 00:07:58,554
Don't... don't...
don't put that...

166
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:03,159

- Hi.

170
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,398
I'm Ben Whittaker.

171
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,134
I received an e-mail
about an interview

172
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:12,869
for the senior intern program.

173
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,136
Hey, Ben.
How's it going?

174
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,604
It's going good, real good.
Thank you.

175
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:17,373
Excellent.
Take a seat around the corner,

176
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:19,541
and someone from talent
acquisition will come get you.

177
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,777
Thank you.

178
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:23,379
"Talent acquisition"?

179
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,014
<i>♪ I'm all about that bass ♪</i>

180
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:26,849
<i>♪ 'Bout that bass, no treble ♪</i>

181
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:31,854
<i>♪ I'm all about that bass,
'bout that bass ♪</i>

182
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:35,224
Okay,
you guys have to remember,

183
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,792
the homepage
has to read in a glance.

184
00:08:36,793 --> 00:08:38,661
- Right.
- Also, you have to get back like this

185
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:41,230
if you want to see what looks
like if you're, like, over 35.

186
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,666
Okay,
so I can't read anything,

187
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,801
but if I could,
what do you want me to see?

188
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:48,438
"Five girls, one shirt"
or "check out the fit"?

189
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:50,339
Well, both, but
what I really want you to see

190
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,441
is the shirt worn by
five different body types.

191
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:54,310
Okay, then
you got to make me see that.

192
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:56,512
Try making the photo grid
bigger.

193
00:08:56,513 --> 00:08:58,814
I love that five.
Can we make it more graphic?

194
00:08:58,815 --> 00:09:00,083
Yeah, that's cool.

195
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:02,151
Maybe hero
the girl in the red shirt.

196
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:03,418
- Jules...
- That is a great red.

197
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:05,154
It is going to
fly out of here.

198
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:07,490
I needed you to sign off
on this, like, two hours ago.

199
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:09,324
I know, I know,
but can you try?

200
00:09:09,325 --> 00:09:10,393
Yep.

201
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:12,128
Mia?
Tell me that thing again.

202
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:15,264
Oh, 40% of our visitors
don't go past the homepage.

203
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:17,233
Which isn't so bad.

204
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:18,768
Yeah,
but we should fix that.

205
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:20,436
Okay, here you go.

206
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:21,371
I love it.

207
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:22,805
Great, and it's up.

208
00:09:22,806 --> 00:09:24,340
Okay.
Thanks, everybody.

209
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:26,909
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

210
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,612
Let's go over
the pitch for Friday.

211
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:31,279
Okay, so...

212
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,481
The Antoinette dress.

213
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,183
Major screw-up
by the vendor.

214
00:09:34,184 --> 00:09:36,485
There's gonna be a couple of
interviews today, Ben.

215
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:39,388
We want to make sure that
we both find the right fit.

216
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,357
Business as usual
is not really our motto,

217
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:43,325
so we hope
you have some fun here.

218
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:46,028
This is the first time we're
hiring senior interns,

219
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:47,262
so some of
our intern questions

220
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,032
may not exactly fit
your profile,

221
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:50,966
but we're gonna go for it
anyway, okay?

222
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:52,068
Fire away.

223
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,135
Okay, good.

224
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,670
Where'd you go to school?

225
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:55,771
I went to Northwestern.

226
00:09:55,772 --> 00:09:57,940
Hey, my brother
went to Northwestern.

227
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:59,442
Probably not
at the same time.

228
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:02,010
Probably not.
He graduated in 2009.

229
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,814
Class of '65.

230
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,814
Wow,
what was your major?

231
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,551
Do you remember?

232
00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:11,587
And after Northwestern
you went on to...?

233
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:13,155
I went to work
for Dex one.

234
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:14,408
Okay, and they made...?

235
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:15,658
Phonebooks.

236
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,192
I was in charge of
overseeing

237
00:10:17,193 --> 00:10:18,694
the printing
of the physical phonebook.

238
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:20,530
I did that for over 20 years,
and before that,

239
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:22,498
I was their
V.P. of sales and advertising.

240
00:10:22,499 --> 00:10:24,700
So, do they still
make phonebooks?

241
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:26,968
I mean, doesn't everyone
just Google numbers?

242
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:29,238
I believe they do, but before Google
that was how you got a number.

243
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,240
Oh, no, no.
Yeah, I... I get it.

244
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:32,942
So 40 years
at the phonebook company?

245
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:34,977
That is amazing,
seriously.

246
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:36,445
Okay, Benjamin.

247
00:10:36,446 --> 00:10:38,514
Now, I'm gonna ask you one of
our more telling questions

248
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:40,282
for all of our interns,
so I want you to, like,

249
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:41,984
this is the one
to really think about, okay?

250
00:10:41,985 --> 00:10:43,652
And...
and take your time.

251
00:10:43,653 --> 00:10:45,823
Where do you see yourself
in 10 years?

252
00:10:47,257 --> 00:10:48,791
When I'm 80?

253
00:10:48,792 --> 00:10:50,692
Yeah, sure.

254
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:51,694
Yeah, whatever.

255
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:53,296
Um...

256
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:55,064
Wait.
Did not realize you were 70.

257
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:57,766
That's, uh... that question just
doesn't work for you, does it?

258
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,668
Should we just scratch that one
and just move on?

259
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:02,137
- It's your call, Justin.
- Okay, that one's gone.

260
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:03,539
You look great, by the way.
So great.

261
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,508
And you're clearly more than
qualified for this job.

262
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:07,008
You're actually, like,
way overqualified,

263
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:08,176
and we were so impressed.

264
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:10,178
You had great interviews,
great video.

265
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,148
You nailed it, Ben.
Congrats.

266
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,716
You're an intern.

267
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:14,817
- Hey.
- Hi.

268
00:11:14,818 --> 00:11:16,385
I need you for two minutes,
uninterrupted.

269
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:17,686
- Okay.
- Remember a few weeks ago,

270
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:19,354
we talked about
the senior intern program?

271
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:20,923
- No.
- Really? We had a...

272
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:23,025
we had a whole, big conversation
about it.

273
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:24,393
We did?
Okay, remind me.

274
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:25,861
Seniors in high school
or college?

275
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:26,963
No, no, no, no.

276
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:29,198
Seniors in life.
Older people.

277
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:30,699
Hold on, what?

278
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,868
I told you I felt like we needed
to do an outreach program.

279
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:34,770
You definitely seemed to be
liking the idea,

280
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:36,805
so I set it in motion.
It's gonna be great.

281
00:11:36,806 --> 00:11:38,173
Hold, please.

282
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:40,375
You're hiring
senior citizen interns?

283
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:41,878
There's been
a ton of research on this,

284
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:44,613
and the results
are actually incredible.

285
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:47,449
I mean, imagine having an intern
with a lifetime of experience,

286
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,851
as opposed to
somebody who spent

287
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,686
the last four years of their
life playing beer pong.

288
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,454
Do they eventually
want jobs here?

289
00:11:52,455 --> 00:11:54,323
No, darling,
they're all retired.

290
00:11:54,324 --> 00:11:56,325
They... they just want
the experience.

291
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:59,261
And I would like one
to work directly with you.

292
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:01,397
Wait, Cameron, no.

293
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:03,599
First of all,
I'm not great with older people.

294
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,434
You know how I am
with my parents.

295
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:07,203
This could be...

296
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:08,437
Why do I
have to have one?

297
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:09,938
Because you have to
set the tone.

298
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:12,441
Now, would you prefer
a man or a woman?

299
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:14,543
There's a great
72-year-old woman, really cute.

300
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,212
That's like the same age
as my Mom.

301
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,613
- That's too weird.
- That's fine.

302
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:19,515
There's a man everyone loves.
He seems amazing.

303
00:12:19,516 --> 00:12:21,383
I watched his video
with the whole group.

304
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:23,853
People were crying.

305
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:26,188
Okay, this is not going to work,
in my opinion.

306
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:28,257
But how long
do I have to do this for?

307
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:31,226
- Minimum?
- Six weeks or we'll be sued.

308
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:33,629
I know we never
talked about this.

309
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,531
Yeah, we did.
For real.

310
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:37,333
He starts tomorrow.

311
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,883
Mm.

312
00:13:00,423 --> 00:13:02,391
Back in action.

313
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:04,826
Thank God.

314
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:07,563
New interns, welcome to ATF.

315
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:09,865
We all work on this one floor,
and that is because

316
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:13,202
we are all about
communication and teamwork.

317
00:13:13,203 --> 00:13:14,570
No one
has a private office,

318
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:16,905
not even our Founder and CEO,
Jules Ostin,

319
00:13:16,906 --> 00:13:20,108
who is actually
right over there.

320
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:22,678
She loves to ride her bike
through the office.

321
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,680
That woman does not
like to waste time.

322
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:26,848
Plus,
she counts it as exercise.

323
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,416
That's adorable.

324
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,285
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

325
00:13:30,286 --> 00:13:32,454
Hey. How you doing?
I'm Davis.

326
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:33,755
Hi, Davis.
Ben Whittaker.

327
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:35,791
- Exciting place, huh?
- Oh, my God.

328
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,527
They had one opening for a
regular-age intern, no offense.

329
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,663
I got it.
I'm so psyched.

330
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:41,863
I'm pretty psyched
myself.

331
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,766
All right,
a few words about Jules.

332
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,901
She started about the fit
only 18 months ago.

333
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:48,103
This whole idea was hatched
at Jules' kitchen table

334
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:49,372
right here in Brooklyn.

335
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:50,973
Jules tried everything on
that she sold,

336
00:13:50,974 --> 00:13:52,040
described the fit herself,

337
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,609
and apparently it worked.

338
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,046
She was online
in four months.

339
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:59,248
She started with 25 employees.

340
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:00,950
She's now up to 216.

341
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:02,751
With you 4, 220.

342
00:14:02,752 --> 00:14:03,985
Wow.

343
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:06,054
Hey, Ben, are you gonna
wear a suit every day?

344
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,156
- You bet.
- Confident.

345
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:09,424
I like how you roll.

346
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:11,427
I like it a lot.

347
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:17,599
We just hit a record high
of 2,500 likes on Instagram.

348
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,718
Yeah!

349
00:14:22,138 --> 00:14:23,472
And that's what we do

350
00:14:23,473 --> 00:14:25,240
when something good
happens around here.

351
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:26,641
New interns, grab a seat

352
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:28,277
at one of the intern tables
over there.

353
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:30,579
Check your e-mail. You may find
that you've been assigned

354
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,448
to one particular person
or one particular team.

355
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:34,917
Or you might just be
a floater.

356
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:36,285
It's all good.

357
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:38,954
Okay,
let me Instagram this.

358
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:40,422
Moment in time.

359
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:42,558
Gray is the new green.

360
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,826
Take a seat.

361
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:32,708
Thanks.

362
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:37,279
Got one.

363
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,049
"Welcome Ben!
Your internship will be

364
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,651
directly with our founder,
Jules Ostin."

365
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:45,387
Oh,
I'm in the photo studio.

366
00:15:45,388 --> 00:15:47,423
Floater.
Love!

367
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:48,824
Hey, Ben,
what'd you get?

368
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,992
Looks like I'm gonna be
a personal intern.

369
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,394
Nice. To?

370
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:53,596
Jules Ostin.

371
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:55,732
Unfortunate.

372
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:58,234
Hang in there.

373
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,306
"Hi Ben,
I have secured an appointment

374
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:07,208
for you to meet with
Jules Ostin today at 3:55 P.M.

375
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:10,946
Please be prompt as Jules has
another meeting at 4:00 P.M."

376
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:13,982
Hmm.

377
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:17,118
All right,
I'm going to merchandising.

378
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:18,522
Beautiful.

379
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:36,038
It's perfect.

380
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,106
Yes, I'll try to
have her there at 5:00.

381
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:39,607
Um, no, wait.

382
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:41,443
I booked her with a vendor
at 5:15.

383
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:43,278
I'm sorry.

384
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,114
I'll call you back.

385
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:46,381
Yes, hello?

386
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:47,750
Hi.
I'm Ben Whittaker.

387
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:50,252
I have a 3:55 appointment
with Ms. Ostin.

388
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:51,654
3:55?

389
00:16:51,655 --> 00:16:53,488
I thought she was meeting with
her new intern.

390
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:55,257
That's me.

391
00:16:55,258 --> 00:16:57,126
How you doing?

392
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,495
I'm sorry, uh,
how are you an intern?

393
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,130
W... it's the new
senior intern program.

394
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:04,033
It just started today.

395
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:05,234
Oh, my God.

396
00:17:05,235 --> 00:17:07,002
Um...

397
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:08,103
How old are you?

398
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:10,038
70. You?

399
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm 24.

400
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:12,307
I know, I look older.

401
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:13,409
It's the job.
It ages you.

402
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,411
Which won't be great
in your case.

403
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:16,712
Sorry.

404
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:18,513
I actually thought
you looked younger.

405
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:20,448
Yeah, right.

406
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:23,587
Any tips
before I go in?

407
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:26,655
Just talk fast.
She hates slow talkers.

408
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:28,491
Maybe that's just
when I talk slow.

409
00:17:28,492 --> 00:17:30,426
Don't dawdle in any way.
Just keep it moving.

410
00:17:30,427 --> 00:17:32,727
And don't forget
to blink.

411
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,162
- Blink?
- Yeah.

412
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:36,198
She hates when people don't
blink. It weirds her out.

413
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,999
But it's 3:57.
This meeting that she's in

414
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,602
just took up like two of your
f... they're out. Go, go, go.

415
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:42,504
- Okay, thanks.
- Go. Yeah.

416
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:43,538
What?

417
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:44,940
Oh, yeah, I'm here.

418
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,342
Hi, Jules?

419
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:49,645
I'm Ben,
your new intern.

420
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:51,746
I'm glad you also
see the humor in this.

421
00:17:51,747 --> 00:17:54,149
Be hard not to.

422
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,351
So, Ben...

423
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:58,921
I was gonna say
what is a nice guy like you

424
00:17:58,922 --> 00:18:00,088
doing at
a place like this?

425
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:01,890
But Cameron
gave me the drill,

426
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,358
so can I just
be honest with you?

427
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,593
Please.

428
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:06,428
I'm not gonna have
a lot for you to do.

429
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:07,762
That's the truth.

430
00:18:07,763 --> 00:18:10,265
And you being assigned to me
is kind of just

431
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:13,035
for me to set an example
for the rest of the team.

432
00:18:13,036 --> 00:18:16,037
If you ask me, I think
that you'd be much better off

433
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:17,573
working in creative
or marketing.

434
00:18:17,574 --> 00:18:18,840
It's a little bit
slower pace,

435
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:20,308
maybe a little bit
easier to grasp.

436
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,644
If you requested to transfer,
we can make that happen.

437
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:24,312
If that's
what you'd prefer.

438
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:28,283
You'll be happier, believe me.
I am not so fun to work for.

439
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:31,286
That's what I gather,
but I can get along with anyone,

440
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:33,355
and I'm here to
learn about your world,

441
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:35,023
give help where I can,
so...

442
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:37,492
So,
you don't want to transfer?

443
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:38,693
Not really, sir.

444
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:41,029
I'm terribly sorry.

445
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,397
Excuse me.

446
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:43,666
Okay.

447
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,467
Well, then, looks like
you're stuck with me.

448
00:18:45,468 --> 00:18:47,102
Great, I'm excited.

449
00:18:47,103 --> 00:18:51,006
I will e-mail you when
I have something for you to do.

450
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,842
Or I could just stop by
a few times a day, check in...?

451
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:55,210
I'll e-mail you.

452
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:57,646
Also, don't feel like
you have to dress up.

453
00:18:57,647 --> 00:18:59,047
I mean,
we're super cas here.

454
00:18:59,048 --> 00:19:02,250
Well, I'm comfortable in a suit,
if it's okay.

455
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:04,053
No, it's fine.

456
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:05,087
Old school.

457
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:06,154
Exactly.

458
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:07,789
At least
I'll stand out.

459
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,025
I don't think you need a suit
to do that.

460
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:11,993
True.

461
00:19:11,994 --> 00:19:15,430
Well, I think we did it
in less than two minutes.

462
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:17,332
I'll wait to
hear from you.

463
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,768
Okay.

464
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:23,271
Want the door
open or closed?

465
00:19:23,272 --> 00:19:24,641
Doesn't matter.

466
00:19:25,808 --> 00:19:27,978
Open, actually.

467
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,247
You'll get used to me.

468
00:19:32,248 --> 00:19:34,016
Look forward to it.

469
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:48,096
Hi.

470
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:49,899
Hi.

471
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:51,666
Hi.

472
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,302
Hi.

473
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:54,903
Howdy.

474
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:56,338
What do you need?

475
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,642
No.

476
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:06,715
What's up, Ben?
Are you good?

477
00:20:06,716 --> 00:20:08,383
Perfect.

478
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:09,952
Okay.

479
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,394
The V-Neck back tee?

480
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:20,462
This is Holly.

481
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:21,730
Can you
run that up to them?

482
00:20:21,731 --> 00:20:23,599
Yeah, no, no, we love
the whole line, mark.

483
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay, so you can zoom out.

484
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:26,702
- Like that.
- I'm going to a meeting.

485
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:28,270
I'll be back in an hour.
We'll talk then?

486
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:30,339
And then you can just
click here to buy it.

487
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,607
Cool, yeah.

488
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:44,486
Hello?

489
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:45,887
Hi, yeah.

490
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:47,656
All right.

491
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:49,191
You staying?

492
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:51,126
Can't leave
before the Boss leaves, Davis.

493
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:52,894
Looks like
you're gonna be here a while.

494
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:55,364
All right.
See you in the morning, Ben.

495
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:56,831
Have a good night.

496
00:20:56,832 --> 00:20:59,035
You, too.

497
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:11,247
Let's make it happen.

498
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:13,983
Thanks.

499
00:21:19,255 --> 00:21:20,889
How about I push,
you deliver?

500
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,591
Thank you.

501
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:25,460
I like that there's four faves
instead of three,

502
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:27,729
but can I see the one
without the jacket just to...

503
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:28,763
Sure.

504
00:21:28,764 --> 00:21:30,100
Hi.

505
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,201
Okay, so they want to know

506
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:34,603
what customers bought
who didn't come back

507
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:36,238
so they can spot a problem
if there is one, right?

508
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,606
Yeah, but
I don't understand how to...

509
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:39,140
all right, well, here's
what I think we should do.

510
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:40,342
- Ben!
- We should go...

511
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:42,210
Ben! Hey, look.
Here she comes.

512
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:43,579
Watch how
she won't even...

513
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,679
hey, Beck.
What's up?

514
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,317
You look
really nice to...

515
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,452
how long can a woman
be mad at you for?

516
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:52,420
Well, it kind of
depends on what you did.

517
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:54,990
Well, first of all,
nothing on purpose.

518
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:56,391
We were going out
for a minute.

519
00:21:56,392 --> 00:21:59,094
I thought she was cool.
I really liked her.

520
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:02,231
But then I sort of
accidentally...

521
00:22:02,232 --> 00:22:04,266
- Slept with her roommate.
- That doesn't help.

522
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:05,534
I didn't know
she was her roommate.

523
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:07,235
I met her out.
How would I know that?

524
00:22:07,236 --> 00:22:09,637
- Hey, Nikki.
- Ben, tell me.

525
00:22:09,638 --> 00:22:10,772
I don't know this stuff.

526
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:12,107
You're older.

527
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:13,641
You've been through
a lot.

528
00:22:13,642 --> 00:22:16,612
I mean, you... I mean,
you have a lot of experience.

529
00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:18,413
How long do you think
she'll be mad at me for?

530
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:20,249
Jay, I have zero experience
with women,

531
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,351
and I can tell you, there's
no coming back from that one.

532
00:22:22,352 --> 00:22:24,452
I mean, I assume
you talked to her, apologized,

533
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:26,455
told her
how much she means to you.

534
00:22:26,456 --> 00:22:28,690
Well, you know...

535
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:29,958
You didn't talk to her?

536
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,493
What did you do,
send her a tweet?

537
00:22:31,494 --> 00:22:32,561
No, of course not.

538
00:22:32,562 --> 00:22:35,297
I, like, texted her
a billion times.

539
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:38,232
She didn't answer,
so then I e-mailed her.

540
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,902
But it was like,
a nice e-mail.

541
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:41,537
It was a long one,
well thought out.

542
00:22:41,538 --> 00:22:43,605
Subject line I wrote,
"I'm sooorry,"

543
00:22:43,606 --> 00:22:44,972
with like a ton of o's.

544
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:46,541
So it was like,
"I'm sooorry,"

545
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:50,345
with a sad emoticon
where he's crying

546
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:53,115
at the side of
its little cheek.

547
00:22:53,116 --> 00:22:55,917
I should probably actually
just talk to her, huh?

548
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,118
Obviously.

549
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,254
Can't imagine
it would hurt.

550
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:01,356
Oh, did yesterday's numbers
come in?

551
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:02,991
Yeah.

552
00:23:02,992 --> 00:23:04,393
We could do it that way,
too.

553
00:23:04,394 --> 00:23:06,661
I noticed my intern
sure keeps busy.

554
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:07,929
Mr. congeniality.

555
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,364
He's a very big hit.

556
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:10,398
Everybody loves him.

557
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:12,166
Okay,
do not look at that desk.

558
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:13,368
It's like
the office junk drawer.

559
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:15,771
It's just gonna
drive you crazy.

560
00:23:15,772 --> 00:23:17,038
You just did that.

561
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,840
What, are you
preparing for surgery?

562
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:22,010
Okay, seriously?

563
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:24,981
Like,
how did this even happen?

564
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:35,056
No, no, I-I can set it up.

565
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:36,457
She's just in a meeting.

566
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,126
Hi.
Something I can help you with?

567
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:40,128
Yes, Jules spilled soy sauce
on her Saint Laurent jacket.

568
00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:41,462
Can you take it
to the photo studio?

569
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,031
There's lots of cleaners
and stuff in there.

570
00:23:43,032 --> 00:23:44,032
Sure.
Where is it?

571
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:45,433
She's wearing it.

572
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:50,772
They would like us
to consider the possibility...

573
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:52,174
Okay.

574
00:23:52,175 --> 00:23:57,278
...of, uh, meeting with
some, uh, potential CEOs.

575
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,847
Wow.

576
00:23:58,848 --> 00:24:02,717
I did not
see that coming.

577
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:06,021
W-Why? Uh...

578
00:24:06,022 --> 00:24:07,956
Am I too inexperienced
at running a business?

579
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:09,324
I-I didn't go to Harvard?

580
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:12,194
My... My methods
aren't by the book?

581
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:15,797
I mean,
isn't that how we got here?

582
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:17,298
Really?

583
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:19,233
I need adult supervision?

584
00:24:19,234 --> 00:24:21,636
Could we be doing better?

585
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:24,606
We hit our five-year goal
in nine months.

586
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:25,974
Exactly.

587
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:27,976
Jules, we can't keep up
with our own success.

588
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:29,511
You know that.

589
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:32,014
You're an hour late
to every meeting.

590
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:34,249
We have a name for it...
Jules standard time.

591
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,984
And look, I get it. There's only
so many hours in the day.

592
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:38,553
We're all playing catchup.

593
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:41,356
Our tech guys work until
2:00, 3:00 in the morning.

594
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:43,391
Customer service
is slammed.

595
00:24:43,392 --> 00:24:44,793
We're running out of
inventory.

596
00:24:44,794 --> 00:24:47,695
We've got shipping issues
and programming problems.

597
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:48,964
And... and the bigger we get,

598
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:50,498
the more complicated
it's gonna get.

599
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:52,667
But isn't this
what a startup is?

600
00:24:52,668 --> 00:24:54,703
What?

601
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:56,904
Say it. What is everyone
so worried about?

602
00:24:56,905 --> 00:25:00,208
That it's all going too fast,
and it could get away from us.

603
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:03,344
Our investors just think
that a seasoned CEO

604
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:05,313
could take some things
off your plate.

605
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:08,083
That's all. Just free you up
to do what you do great.

606
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:09,451
You come up with the ideas,

607
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:11,286
and let somebody else
make the trains run on time.

608
00:25:11,287 --> 00:25:12,788
But, Cameron,
this new person,

609
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:14,956
they are going to
want to do things their way.

610
00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:16,490
Technically
be my Boss.

611
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:19,094
I mean,
how can I do what I do

612
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:20,996
if I have to
report to someone else,

613
00:25:20,997 --> 00:25:23,165
run every idea I have
by this person?

614
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,532
Can you
see that working?

615
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,801
Well,
gilt groupe brought in a CEO.

616
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:28,571
How are they doing?

617
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:33,541
I mean, get me CEO lessons,
you know?

618
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:37,813
Uh, excuse me.

619
00:25:37,814 --> 00:25:39,580
I apologize,

620
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,583
but Becky said you needed
something taken care of

621
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,485
on your jacket.

622
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:46,522
Oh, right.

623
00:25:56,698 --> 00:25:57,799
Thank you, Ben.

624
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,469
Of course.

625
00:26:01,437 --> 00:26:05,207
The V.C.S made up a list
of potential CEOs.

626
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,075
Let's just take a look
at the list.

627
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:09,811
Explore it,
then decide.

628
00:26:09,812 --> 00:26:11,547
Baby steps.

629
00:26:15,817 --> 00:26:17,085
Ben.

630
00:26:17,086 --> 00:26:18,753
Something big
going on in there?

631
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:20,055
I couldn't say.

632
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:21,756
You were in there
a long time.

633
00:26:21,757 --> 00:26:23,525
I can't hear a thing.

634
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:25,460
Psst!

635
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:27,328
Say something
about me to her.

636
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:30,066
No, you have to do it.

637
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:34,735
On my way, Boss.

638
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:36,104
Hmm. Boss.

639
00:26:52,221 --> 00:26:53,622
Hey, Ben. Ben.

640
00:26:53,623 --> 00:26:55,223
How old's
that briefcase?

641
00:26:55,224 --> 00:26:58,326
It's a 1973 executive ashburn
attaché.

642
00:26:58,327 --> 00:26:59,994
They don't make it anymore.

643
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:01,496
I'm a little
in love with it.

644
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:03,800
It's a classic, Lewis.
It's unbeatable.

645
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:08,369
Good night.

646
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,705
Bye.

647
00:27:29,992 --> 00:27:33,394
Oh, my God.
Somebody cleaned up that desk.

648
00:27:33,395 --> 00:27:37,832
I swear, I was gonna stay late
and do this myself.

649
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,467
Wasn't me.

650
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:41,903
Ben came in at 7:00 this morning
and did it.

651
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:43,437
Who?

652
00:27:43,438 --> 00:27:44,506
Ben.

653
00:27:44,507 --> 00:27:46,274
Your intern.

654
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:48,476
Ben Whittaker.

655
00:27:48,477 --> 00:27:51,213
Someone's very happy.

656
00:27:51,214 --> 00:27:53,415
Brilliant.
Thank you.

657
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:55,718
Best thing that's happened
around here all week.

658
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:07,230
Thank you.

659
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,568
This is your gift
for a job well done.

660
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:18,205
I'm Fiona,
the house masseuse.

661
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:19,741
Hi, Fiona.

662
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:20,643
- Hi.
- Ben.

663
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:22,210
Hi.
Does that feel okay?

664
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:23,678
It feels great, actually.
Thank you.

665
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,847
Okay. You're a little bit tight,
Ben.

666
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:27,448
Well, I haven't sat at a desk
for a while.

667
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:29,717
- My body's not used to it.
- No, I get it.

668
00:28:29,718 --> 00:28:33,020
Plus, they say
sitting is the new smoking.

669
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:34,589
Let me see
what I can do.

670
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,091
I, uh, spotted you
in the lunchroom.

671
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,360
I wondered who you were.

672
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:39,628
- Did you? Oh.
- Yeah.

673
00:28:39,629 --> 00:28:41,596
Then someone told me
you were an intern.

674
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:43,597
That's pretty cool of you
to do this.

675
00:28:43,598 --> 00:28:45,500
Well, it's a brave new world.
Thought I'd jump in.

676
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:46,634
See what it's all about.

677
00:28:46,635 --> 00:28:49,437
Yeah, I know.
Absolutely.

678
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,440
I'm constantly amazed
at what they do here.

679
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:54,141
Love being
a part of it.

680
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:55,576
Oh.

681
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:57,345
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

682
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,247
There. Yeah.
Right there.

683
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:02,249
How's that, Ben?

684
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,886
Well, it's... oh, boy.

685
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:06,321
Good.

686
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:08,656
Jason.

687
00:29:08,657 --> 00:29:11,360
Okay, good.
Good, good.

688
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:14,829
There, good.

689
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,065
Here you go.

690
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:18,966
A little tight
right here.

691
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,134
Is that better?

692
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,203
- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- Oh, how's that?

693
00:29:22,204 --> 00:29:24,572
Oh, boy.

694
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:26,807
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Ben.

695
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,444
Love that there's another
oldie but goodie here.

696
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:31,079
Nice to meet you.

697
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,113
See you later?

698
00:29:32,114 --> 00:29:33,147
Love to.

699
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:34,717
Me, too.

700
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:42,156
You're not as old
as I thought you were.

701
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,659
Ooh!

702
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,996
Wait, so you're saying
you shave every day?

703
00:29:47,997 --> 00:29:49,430
- Yes.
- Even on Sundays?

704
00:29:49,431 --> 00:29:51,966
- Every day.
- Okay, and even if you know

705
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:53,634
that you're not gonna see
anyone that you know?

706
00:29:53,635 --> 00:29:56,104
- Yes.
- How is this possible?

707
00:29:56,105 --> 00:29:57,639
I'm on
Cheapapartments.com,

708
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,241
and I literally can't afford
a single apartment

709
00:30:00,242 --> 00:30:01,676
in all of Brooklyn.

710
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,478
My parents gave me two weeks
to find a place,

711
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:06,481
and that's just not
gonna happen.

712
00:30:06,482 --> 00:30:07,749
Getting evicted?

713
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,384
Hey, I'm in no rush,
but apparently they are.

714
00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:13,788
All right, here.
Let me see your phone.

715
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:16,324
Cheapapartments.com.
Have you tried Craigslist?

716
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:19,595
- Yes.
- Okay. Then I am out of ideas.

717
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:29,804
Jules. Hi.
How are you?

718
00:30:29,805 --> 00:30:31,574
Hi. How are you?

719
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:40,481
- Hey.
- Hey.

720
00:30:40,482 --> 00:30:42,217
- How's it going?
- Well, good.

721
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:44,385
- Mike, right?
- Yeah.

722
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:46,120
Yeah, I'm Ben.
I work for Jules.

723
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:47,890
- Yeah, she'll be down in a minute.
- I know.

724
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:49,691
Look, I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable,

725
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:51,626
but I just happen to have
looked out the window,

726
00:30:51,627 --> 00:30:53,228
and it appeared
you were drinking something

727
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:54,963
from a paper bag.

728
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:57,333
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

729
00:30:58,601 --> 00:31:00,634
Why don't you tell her
you can't drive her today,

730
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:02,538
or I'm gonna have to.

731
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:07,809
We all good?

732
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,345
Yeah.

733
00:31:18,453 --> 00:31:20,822
Jules,
I'm sorry to do this,

734
00:31:20,823 --> 00:31:23,457
but I'm actually
not feeling so hot.

735
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:24,726
Not sure I should be driving.

736
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:25,926
I wouldn't want to
give you anything.

737
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,028
Oh, sure.

738
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:28,395
Yeah, no, you should
take the day off

739
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:29,797
and feel better, okay?

740
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:31,500
Thanks.

741
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,937
I'm happy
to cover for Mike.

742
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,972
That's okay.
Becky can drive me.

743
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:40,343
Really?
You want to give her more to do?

744
00:31:44,914 --> 00:31:47,147
I hope you don't mind
if I don't get in the front.

745
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:49,651
I-I'm not trying to be rude.
I just think better in the back.

746
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:50,785
I mean, I could
get in the front, but...

747
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:52,920
no, no, no.
This is perfect.

748
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:54,021
Yeah.

749
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:59,694
And everything you hear in the
car is strictly confidential.

750
00:31:59,695 --> 00:32:01,596
- Okay?
- Goes without saying.

751
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:03,631
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, I found you.

752
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:06,066
Yeah. So, what's up?
How's everything?

753
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:08,002
Well, your Dad and I
are finally putting together

754
00:32:08,003 --> 00:32:09,837
all our research
at the hospital.

755
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:11,073
That's great.

756
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:13,407
I hear you typing.

757
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:14,742
That's better.

758
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:16,544
So, we've been studying
women under 40

759
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:18,546
who sleep less than
six hours a night.

760
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:20,848
- And what'd you find out?
- It's interesting.

761
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:22,917
It seems like
they're 38% more likely

762
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:24,652
to experience major weight gain

763
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:27,088
compared to women who slept
seven hours a night.

764
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:28,422
Are you kidding me?

765
00:32:28,423 --> 00:32:29,991
You know I haven't slept
in two years.

766
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:32,226
Well, I can't change
the facts, dear.

767
00:32:32,227 --> 00:32:35,296
Mom, you know what? I'm rushing into the
city for a meeting and I need to prepare.

768
00:32:35,297 --> 00:32:37,197
Can I call you
when I get home?

769
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:38,999
Oh, you don't have to.

770
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,768
Okay. Love you.

771
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:42,638
Thank you.

772
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:48,009
Hey, how we doing?

773
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,144
Did you look over
the material on Atwood?

774
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:51,579
Yeah, I did.

775
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,248
Uh, he had a great run at
Travelocity and Citigroup...

776
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:55,683
And I get it.
He's major.

777
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:57,751
He is.
And the best thing about him

778
00:32:57,752 --> 00:33:00,522
is he's been watching us,
and he loves what we're doing.

779
00:33:00,523 --> 00:33:01,856
But he's only one of the names
on the list.

780
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,624
So if you don't like him,
we move on.

781
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,494
But, Jules,
try to be open.

782
00:33:06,495 --> 00:33:07,661
He's supposed to
be brilliant.

783
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:09,831
And the V.C.S love him.
A lot.

784
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:12,033
Mark Zuckerberg
never brought in a CEO,

785
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:13,634
and he was a teenager.

786
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:15,236
Call me after.

787
00:33:15,237 --> 00:33:17,440
Okay.

788
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,675
Oh, thanks,
but you don't have to.

789
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:22,276
- I can open the door.
- Sure.

790
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:24,779
Okay, so, this shouldn't
take more than an hour.

791
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,080
But if you can't stay here,

792
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,882
I'll call Becky
and then she'll find you.

793
00:33:27,883 --> 00:33:29,183
And then
you can just pull up...

794
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:31,386
don't worry.
I'll be here.

795
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:33,788
I think I forgot to eat today.

796
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:35,756
Should I pick you up
some sushi?

797
00:33:35,757 --> 00:33:37,926
No,
I eat too much mercury.

798
00:33:37,927 --> 00:33:39,627
I'll be fine.
I'm good.

799
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:41,462
I'm actually kind of nauseous,
so...

800
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,696
That was fast.

801
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:17,165
Not fast enough.

802
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:20,034
Oh, I-I picked you up some soup
from a place I know.

803
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:21,068
Thanks.

804
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:24,372
You really didn't have to d...
to do...

805
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:26,340
oh, my God,
that smells so good.

806
00:34:26,341 --> 00:34:27,676
Good.

807
00:34:30,846 --> 00:34:33,147
Word travels fast.

808
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:34,348
Pretty short meeting.

809
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:36,484
- Yeah. I hated him.
- Really? What happened?

810
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:39,587
I thought he was a condescending,
sexist know-it-all

811
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:41,755
who did not seem to get
what we do at all.

812
00:34:41,756 --> 00:34:44,091
And, honestly, I think
he would run our business

813
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:46,260
in a completely inorganic way
that would lose us

814
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:49,097
all the customers
we have killed ourselves to get.

815
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:51,132
Oh, and I think
that he would replace us

816
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:52,666
as soon as
he got the chance.

817
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:53,868
Oh, and...

818
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:56,871
The man never blinked.

819
00:34:56,872 --> 00:34:59,107
An olympian non-blinker.

820
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:00,975
Okay, then.

821
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:02,242
Yeah.

822
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:04,411
See you in the A.M.?

823
00:35:04,412 --> 00:35:07,348
Be there or be square.

824
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:08,716
I'm sorry.

825
00:35:08,717 --> 00:35:10,952
Hey, don't be.

826
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:36,210
I just wanted to say thank you
for helping out with Mike today

827
00:35:36,211 --> 00:35:37,912
and for
getting me chicken soup.

828
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:41,382
Oh, and for cleaning that mess.
That was awesome.

829
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:42,683
Seriously.

830
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,653
You're very welcome.

831
00:35:46,822 --> 00:35:49,390
It's okay.
I really won't bite.

832
00:35:49,391 --> 00:35:53,127
You started this business all by
yourself a year and a half ago,

833
00:35:53,128 --> 00:35:55,596
and now you have
a staff of 220 people.

834
00:35:55,597 --> 00:35:57,397
Remember who did that.

835
00:35:57,398 --> 00:35:58,566
Who?

836
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:02,736
Um, thank you.

837
00:36:02,737 --> 00:36:05,941
And I hate to say it,
but try to get some sleep.

838
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:10,678
- Mommy.
- Hey!

839
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,779
Hi.

840
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,315
- Hi.
- Here's my favorite girl.

841
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:17,318
Hey, baby.

842
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:18,854
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

843
00:36:20,155 --> 00:36:22,024
Over the hump.

844
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:25,559
So, how was your day?

845
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,194
Kind of okay.
But you know what?

846
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:30,164
Maddie said she didn't want to
be my friend anymore.

847
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:31,332
Oh.

848
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,067
You know what?
I don't think she meant it.

849
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:34,935
She'd miss you too much.

850
00:36:34,936 --> 00:36:38,772
I'm starting to think
that Maddie is bipolar.

851
00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:41,175
We go through this
every other day.

852
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:42,276
We do.

853
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:44,712
Oh, how was your meeting?
It was today, right?

854
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:46,380
Yeah, just had it.

855
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:48,749
Mommy, I think I'm winning.
Look!

856
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,718
Oh, that is so cool.

857
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:53,021
Yeah, that's
the play-doh cake challenge.

858
00:36:53,022 --> 00:36:54,688
We're not finishing
until tomorrow,

859
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:56,924
so please hold
on all judging.

860
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,360
Not to mention that we had
an accident with mine

861
00:36:59,361 --> 00:37:02,930
when someone, not to name
any names, put her elbow in it.

862
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,098
- What?
- It was an accident.

863
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:08,035
Well, I got to say,
I love the pink one a lot.

864
00:37:08,036 --> 00:37:10,337
That's mine.
Are you happy at me?

865
00:37:10,338 --> 00:37:13,874
I am so happy at you.
I'm beyond happy at you.

866
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:15,876
Daddy helped me
with the icing.

867
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:17,378
Good job, you guys.

868
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:19,146
So, how about
I give you your bath, okay?

869
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:20,647
Wait, hang on.
I was waiting for your call.

870
00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:22,716
So,
you didn't like the guy?

871
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:25,052
He wasn't
a good fit for me.

872
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:28,422
But a lot of other names
on the list, so...

873
00:37:28,423 --> 00:37:29,557
Yeah.

874
00:37:29,558 --> 00:37:31,392
I'm gonna
beat you upstairs.

875
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:34,895
<i>♪ Do I want you? ♪</i>

876
00:37:34,896 --> 00:37:38,199
<i>♪ Oh, my, do I? ♪</i>

877
00:37:39,568 --> 00:37:41,736
Ben,
I haven't seen you in days.

878
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:43,871
That's right, homey.
Ben's got a job.

879
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:45,906
Oh, you're never home.

880
00:37:45,907 --> 00:37:49,210
What do you do...
never mind. It's Patty.

881
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:54,915

885
00:38:06,628 --> 00:38:07,728
Hello?

886
00:38:07,729 --> 00:38:09,396
Hi, uh, Fiona.

887
00:38:09,397 --> 00:38:11,866
It's Ben Whittaker
from about the fit.

888
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:14,635
Oh, hey.
It's good to hear your voice.

889
00:38:14,636 --> 00:38:16,237
Oh, it's good
to hear your voice, too.

890
00:38:16,238 --> 00:38:18,439
It was great
meeting you today.

891
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,908
I called you quicker
than you thought I would.

892
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:22,945
I'm glad you did.

893
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,555
Jules.

894
00:38:34,556 --> 00:38:37,491
Shh.
Let her sleep, Dad.

895
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:39,560
Okay.

896
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:42,331
Okay.

897
00:38:46,268 --> 00:38:47,968
When I heard that,
I was like, "good,

898
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:50,637
because I definitely wasn't
eating lunchables before."

899
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:55,009
Yeah, they're coming out with

900
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,844
a more grown-up version
of lunchables.

901
00:38:56,845 --> 00:38:59,246
Uh, they're called
so you still can't cook-ables.

902
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:02,850
Uh, grow-up-ables already.

903
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:12,293
I tried to stay up.

904
00:39:12,294 --> 00:39:13,928
I know.

905
00:39:13,929 --> 00:39:16,964
I'm sorry I fell asleep in there.
I just passed out.

906
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:20,133
I know we had a plan to have
a grown-up conversation.

907
00:39:20,134 --> 00:39:23,138
You want to
Netflix something?

908
00:39:29,677 --> 00:39:31,144
Hm?

909
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,780
I'm sorry.
I just fell out for a second.

910
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:36,016
It's okay.

911
00:39:36,017 --> 00:39:38,586
Paige learned to say
"humongous" today.

912
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:39,753
Really?

913
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:41,188
Cracks me up.

914
00:39:41,189 --> 00:39:43,224
She looks at me,
she says,

915
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:46,760
"you're a very humongous Dad,
Dad."

916
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:47,761
Oh.

917
00:39:49,664 --> 00:39:53,634
Oh, God. You know I hate
to sound like the other Moms.

918
00:39:53,635 --> 00:39:56,503
But I'm starting to feel like
I need a little me time.

919
00:39:56,504 --> 00:39:59,274
I know.

920
00:40:06,315 --> 00:40:07,850
Good night.

921
00:40:14,656 --> 00:40:16,890
Anybody home?

922
00:40:16,891 --> 00:40:19,893
Can't keep my eyes open,
Jule.

923
00:40:19,894 --> 00:40:21,496
We'll do it tomorrow,
okay?

924
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,113
Can you turn out
your light?

925
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:56,398
Hello?

926
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:57,998
Hey, Ben.
It's Becky.

927
00:40:57,999 --> 00:40:59,367
From Jules' office?

928
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:00,834
Yeah, hey.
What's up?

929
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,069
Jules' driver is M.I.A.

930
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,304
He's not answering
any of my texts.

931
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:05,072
I know
you drove Jules yesterday,

932
00:41:05,073 --> 00:41:06,440
and I didn't hear
any complaints.

933
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:07,975
So can you pick her up
this morning?

934
00:41:07,976 --> 00:41:10,111
- Sure.
- You know where she lives?

935
00:41:10,112 --> 00:41:12,947
- I was there yesterday.
- Okay, so you remember.

936
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:14,748
- Yeah.
- And you're hearing me, right?

937
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:16,350
Loud and clear, Boss.

938
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,785
Okay, so be there at 7:45,
ring the bell, and walk away.

939
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:19,887
She'll know it's you.

940
00:41:19,888 --> 00:41:21,556
Ring bell, walk away.
Got it.

941
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:29,264
Oh, walk away.

942
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:32,266
Hang on.
I'm coming.

943
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:33,634
Hi. Here for Jules?

944
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:35,336
Yeah, hi, sorry.
I'll wait in the car.

945
00:41:35,337 --> 00:41:37,771
Uh, she's on a call.
Do you want to come in?

946
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:39,139
I just made some coffee.

947
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,474
Could be a while.

948
00:41:40,475 --> 00:41:41,643
I'm Matt.

949
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:44,412
Ben Whittaker.

950
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:46,113
Good to meet you.
Come on in.

951
00:41:46,114 --> 00:41:48,616
Legos everywhere,
so watch your step.

952
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:49,850
Sure.

953
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:52,620
Maybe feature some
bloggers on the homepage?

954
00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:54,322
Have a seat, Ben.

955
00:41:54,323 --> 00:41:56,256
Hey, Paige, this is Ben.
He works with Mommy.

956
00:41:56,257 --> 00:41:57,491
- Hi.
- Hi.

957
00:41:57,492 --> 00:41:59,326
I'm playing
Princess Memory game.

958
00:41:59,327 --> 00:42:02,029
Oh, yeah.
Looks like you're about to win.

959
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,464
So,
your Jules' new driver?

960
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:05,766
No, actually,
I'm her intern.

961
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:08,001
That's hysterical.

962
00:42:08,002 --> 00:42:10,072
- You know what an intern is?
- No.

963
00:42:10,073 --> 00:42:11,906
That's okay.
Everyone thinks it's hysterical.

964
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,708
Hey, Matt, did a...

965
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:16,510
morning.

966
00:42:16,511 --> 00:42:19,012
Morning.

967
00:42:19,013 --> 00:42:21,148
Is that all
dry-cleaning?

968
00:42:21,149 --> 00:42:23,384
These three are.
These two are laundry.

969
00:42:23,385 --> 00:42:25,919
And this button...
this button is missing.

970
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,387
I mean, it's loose, so...

971
00:42:27,388 --> 00:42:28,422
- Okay.
- If they could just...

972
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:29,723
- You got it.
- Thanks.

973
00:42:29,724 --> 00:42:31,158
Hey, and, honey,
uh, before you leave,

974
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:32,493
just got to
go over a couple things.

975
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:33,560
Okay.

976
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:36,030
- Look who I found.
- Yay!

977
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:38,332
- He was in your hamper.
- Thank you.

978
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,066
Matty,
did an ATF box arrive for me?

979
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:41,468
On the table.

980
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:43,470
Uh, I... I think
I'll just wait... wait out...

981
00:42:43,471 --> 00:42:46,807
Ben.
Do you want a raisin?

982
00:42:46,808 --> 00:42:48,476
Thank you.

983
00:42:48,477 --> 00:42:51,278
Okay, so tonight,
you're working...

984
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:53,380
Are you listening,
or did I lose you?

985
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:54,448
Ben,
is she listening?

986
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:55,916
I am totally listening.

987
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:58,285
I ordered some stuff
to check on how it arrived.

988
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:00,287
Not great,
by the way.

989
00:43:00,288 --> 00:43:01,488
Go on.
Tonight?

990
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:03,290
Yeah, okay.
You're working,

991
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:06,127
so Paige and I are gonna
go to my Mom's for dinner.

992
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:08,162
After school's
Ruby's birthday party.

993
00:43:08,163 --> 00:43:09,863
And, uh,
what about next Monday?

994
00:43:09,864 --> 00:43:11,999
Do you know yet if we can go to
dinner with Robbie and Annie?

995
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,603
Oh,
I'm so slammed next week.

996
00:43:15,703 --> 00:43:18,105
I'm sorry.
If you want to go, I'll make it.

997
00:43:18,106 --> 00:43:20,809
- When was it?
- Oh, my God. Monday.

998
00:43:22,343 --> 00:43:24,979
Okay, I'm sorry. I was fixated
on this tissue paper.

999
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,380
I will be there.

1000
00:43:26,381 --> 00:43:27,747
Okay.

1001
00:43:27,748 --> 00:43:30,884
Thank you for the coffee.
Thanks for letting me play.

1002
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:32,018
Oh! Sorry.

1003
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:33,320
I'll meet you in the car.

1004
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:35,555
Actually, I have to go.
Come on, sweetie.

1005
00:43:35,556 --> 00:43:37,024
Ben, we're gonna
drop Paige at school, okay?

1006
00:43:37,025 --> 00:43:38,425
- Here we go.
- Let's do it.

1007
00:43:38,426 --> 00:43:41,395
Kiss Daddy goodbye.
Mwah!

1008
00:43:41,396 --> 00:43:44,765
Hey, wait.
You forgot your doggy.

1009
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,571
Matt seems like
a terrific guy.

1010
00:43:50,572 --> 00:43:51,957
Hmm?

1011
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:53,340
Sorry,
didn't mean to interrupt.

1012
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:56,009
Uh, that's okay.
I agree. He is.

1013
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,511
Who? The Dad?

1014
00:43:57,512 --> 00:43:59,613
That's what the other kids
call Matt

1015
00:43:59,614 --> 00:44:02,449
because he's the only Dad
in a sea of Moms.

1016
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:03,917
I've read about
these househusbands.

1017
00:44:03,918 --> 00:44:05,819
It's interesting
how that all worked just now.

1018
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,156
They actually prefer to be
called stay-at-home Dads.

1019
00:44:09,157 --> 00:44:11,124
Oh, sorry.
Did not know that.

1020
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,093
Well,
it's very admirable.

1021
00:44:13,094 --> 00:44:15,062
He's a real
21st-century father.

1022
00:44:15,063 --> 00:44:16,363
He is.

1023
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:18,298
He actually
had a great job in marketing,

1024
00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:20,334
but, um,
when about the fit took off,

1025
00:44:20,335 --> 00:44:23,003
he left
to be a full-time Dad.

1026
00:44:23,004 --> 00:44:25,607
Totally saved our butts.

1027
00:44:38,353 --> 00:44:40,286
Oh, we're here,
big girl.

1028
00:44:40,287 --> 00:44:42,689
I do this in the cafeteria

1029
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:46,026
to my lunch friends
when they're don't looking.

1030
00:44:46,027 --> 00:44:47,628
- You do that?
- Hey, Jules.

1031
00:44:47,629 --> 00:44:49,729
Hi.
Nice to see you here.

1032
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,332
Uh, not sure
if you got our e-mail,

1033
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,033
but we're doing a fiesta lunch
next Friday,

1034
00:44:53,034 --> 00:44:55,002
and we thought
you could bring the guacamole.

1035
00:44:55,003 --> 00:44:58,205
Uh, you probably won't have time
to make it, so you can buy it.

1036
00:44:58,206 --> 00:44:59,973
Which is fine.

1037
00:44:59,974 --> 00:45:01,842
Enough for 18.

1038
00:45:01,843 --> 00:45:03,576
No, I can make it.
It's not a problem.

1039
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:05,679
Great.
Matt can bring it.

1040
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,713
Totally.

1041
00:45:06,714 --> 00:45:08,548
Bye.

1042
00:45:08,549 --> 00:45:11,385
All right.
Have a great day, sweet pea.

1043
00:45:11,386 --> 00:45:12,853
Have fun at Ruby's party,
okay?

1044
00:45:12,854 --> 00:45:16,256
Mommy? Do you know how
to make guacamole?

1045
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:17,824
Yes, I do.
Really well, in fact.

1046
00:45:17,825 --> 00:45:19,626
We're...
we're gonna make it together.

1047
00:45:19,627 --> 00:45:21,862
And after that, we'll have
a mother-daughter dance party?

1048
00:45:24,098 --> 00:45:26,234
Hey, Maddie.
What's up?

1049
00:45:28,903 --> 00:45:30,871
Bipolar.

1050
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:32,339
Oh, my God.

1051
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,574
Come here.

1052
00:45:33,575 --> 00:45:35,008
Oh, I love you,
big girl.

1053
00:45:35,009 --> 00:45:36,643
I love you, too.

1054
00:45:36,644 --> 00:45:39,145
God.

1055
00:45:39,146 --> 00:45:41,482
Taking the high road
is exhausting.

1056
00:45:41,483 --> 00:45:43,351
It's 2015.

1057
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:45,419
Are we really still critical
of working Moms?

1058
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,121
Seriously? Still?

1059
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:51,458
I'm sorry.
That was all rhetorical.

1060
00:45:51,459 --> 00:45:53,026
There's no need
to respond.

1061
00:45:53,027 --> 00:45:54,461
Wasn't going to.

1062
00:46:11,713 --> 00:46:13,080
Oh, Ben.

1063
00:46:13,081 --> 00:46:14,481
I want to
stop by the warehouse.

1064
00:46:14,482 --> 00:46:16,149
480 Greenpoint.

1065
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,485
Sure.

1066
00:46:18,686 --> 00:46:20,820
No, no, no, no.
You want to make a right.

1067
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:22,756
9th to Hamilton
to the expressway.

1068
00:46:22,757 --> 00:46:25,959
Uh, I think we should take
4th to Flatbush. Much faster.

1069
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,495
I-It won't be.

1070
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:30,697
By 12 minutes, at least.

1071
00:46:30,698 --> 00:46:31,933
Can I try?

1072
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:36,103
I apologize.

1073
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:37,838
No need.

1074
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,076
Try to line the dots up
the best you can.

1075
00:46:42,077 --> 00:46:43,844
And then...

1076
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:45,012
Okay.

1077
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:48,081
If you can,
try to pull this towards you,

1078
00:46:48,082 --> 00:46:49,149
holding it on the outside.

1079
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,486
Good meeting you.

1080
00:46:56,224 --> 00:46:57,791
Okay, so then
put that on lightly.

1081
00:46:57,792 --> 00:46:59,928
Put it down with two.
Secure it.

1082
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,398
Our package should feel like
they're getting

1083
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:06,635
a little gift
that they bought for themselves.

1084
00:47:08,803 --> 00:47:12,072
<i>♪ Tall and tan
and young and lovely ♪</i>

1085
00:47:12,073 --> 00:47:13,773
<i>♪ The girl from Ipanema
goes walking ♪</i>

1086
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:17,277
It's open.

1087
00:47:17,278 --> 00:47:18,345
Ben.

1088
00:47:18,346 --> 00:47:19,847
- Wow.
- Come on in.

1089
00:47:19,848 --> 00:47:21,849
- Didn't expect this.
- Yeah.

1090
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,518
I like to think of it
as a little bit of paradise.

1091
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:27,088
- Can I interest you in a back rub?
- Oh, no, thanks.

1092
00:47:27,091 --> 00:47:29,722
I just came by because
I found out I have to work late.

1093
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:31,692
Oh.
Then no dinner tonight.

1094
00:47:31,693 --> 00:47:34,561
Sorry. I was really
looking forward to it.

1095
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:36,162
But I'm hoping
we can pick another night.

1096
00:47:36,163 --> 00:47:38,198
Of course.
Come sit down.

1097
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:39,866
Let me have your jacket.

1098
00:47:39,867 --> 00:47:41,367
- Oh.
- Just for a minute.

1099
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:43,303
Come on. Relax.

1100
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:46,039
Okay,
how about a foot massage?

1101
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,407
During office hours?

1102
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:49,643
Yeah,
that's kind of the point.

1103
00:47:49,644 --> 00:47:52,312
- May I?
- Well...

1104
00:47:52,313 --> 00:47:54,482
Okay.

1105
00:47:57,018 --> 00:47:58,318
It's already
pretty good.

1106
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,286
All I've done
is take off your sock.

1107
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:02,422
Well,
no one's ever done that better.

1108
00:48:02,423 --> 00:48:04,090
Just relax.

1109
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:05,325
Close your eyes.

1110
00:48:05,326 --> 00:48:07,060
Put your head back.

1111
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:08,495
Oh.

1112
00:48:08,496 --> 00:48:10,497
So, when would you
like to reschedule?

1113
00:48:10,498 --> 00:48:11,932
Tomorrow?

1114
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:14,201
Can't tomorrow.
What about Saturday?

1115
00:48:14,202 --> 00:48:15,435
Good.

1116
00:48:15,436 --> 00:48:18,205
Oh, God.
This is enormously satisfying.

1117
00:48:18,206 --> 00:48:19,472
What time
should I pick you up?

1118
00:48:19,473 --> 00:48:21,641
Noon?
I love daytime dates.

1119
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:23,643
Lunch, perfect.
It's sooner.

1120
00:48:23,644 --> 00:48:26,012
So, how's it going?
How's Jules?

1121
00:48:26,013 --> 00:48:28,582
I mean, she works on
all cylinders all the time.

1122
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:31,685
Doesn't stop, doesn't sleep,
never see her eat.

1123
00:48:31,686 --> 00:48:34,154
Maybe it's good that I'm here,
you know?

1124
00:48:34,155 --> 00:48:35,956
I hope I can help her.

1125
00:48:35,957 --> 00:48:39,092
I knew
you were gonna be a good guy.

1126
00:48:39,093 --> 00:48:40,562
I knew it.

1127
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:43,830
Try to relax.

1128
00:48:43,831 --> 00:48:45,264
Oh.

1129
00:48:45,265 --> 00:48:46,800
Oh.

1130
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:47,867
Oh.

1131
00:48:47,868 --> 00:48:49,269
Ooh.

1132
00:48:53,407 --> 00:48:56,111
Oh. Wow.

1133
00:48:57,478 --> 00:48:58,812
Oh, my God.

1134
00:48:58,813 --> 00:49:00,380
I'm sorry! I'm leaving!
I'm leaving!

1135
00:49:00,381 --> 00:49:02,416
Sorry! Don't stop!
I'm leaving.

1136
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:03,817
Oh, my shoe.

1137
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:04,953
Sorry.

1138
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,891
- So?
- I don't know, kid.

1139
00:49:10,892 --> 00:49:12,459
This lease
doesn't look so hot to me.

1140
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,228
Three-month security deposit.
You must really love this place.

1141
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:16,697
No, it's horrible.

1142
00:49:16,698 --> 00:49:19,132
But I can get in
this week.

1143
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:21,534
Well, if I were you,
I'd keep looking.

1144
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:22,836
- Okay.
- Hey, Lewis.

1145
00:49:22,837 --> 00:49:25,004
What's up?
I've never seen you so awake.

1146
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,974
I was just asked to deliver
this huge order to Tribeca,

1147
00:49:27,975 --> 00:49:29,742
and I think
it's to Jay Z's apartment.

1148
00:49:29,743 --> 00:49:31,377
I'm not kidding.
Look, it says, "S. Carter."

1149
00:49:31,378 --> 00:49:33,680
- I'm a little freaked out.
- I don't know who that is,

1150
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:35,348
but is this
someone you want to impress?

1151
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:37,017
This is a genius, Ben.

1152
00:49:37,018 --> 00:49:38,553
Whoa, what if Beyoncé
opens the door?

1153
00:49:38,554 --> 00:49:40,086
Oh, my God.

1154
00:49:40,087 --> 00:49:41,821
Okay, now I know
who you're talking about.

1155
00:49:41,822 --> 00:49:44,424
Well, maybe you should put on
a proper shirt with a collar.

1156
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:46,193
A collar?
These are hip-hop people.

1157
00:49:46,194 --> 00:49:48,662
Dress to impress, Lewis.
Go to the rack.

1158
00:49:48,663 --> 00:49:50,229
Find a boyfriend shirt
that fits.

1159
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,866
Bring the hair down if you can.
Tuck in the shirt.

1160
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:54,701
Why doesn't anybody
tuck anything in anymore?

1161
00:49:54,702 --> 00:49:56,169
Oh, I'm asking you.

1162
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,237
Okay, okay.

1163
00:49:57,238 --> 00:49:59,439
Benjamin...

1164
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,974
We made some progress.

1165
00:50:00,975 --> 00:50:02,709
Very big day
for the intern team.

1166
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:03,843
It was great.

1167
00:50:03,844 --> 00:50:05,078
I mean, she yelled at me,
but...

1168
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:06,479
she yells at me
all the time, too.

1169
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,680
Right?
It was communication.

1170
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:08,982
- Yeah.
- It was a breakthrough.

1171
00:50:08,983 --> 00:50:10,016
Yeah.

1172
00:50:10,017 --> 00:50:11,785
Whoo!
Oh, you want one too?

1173
00:50:11,786 --> 00:50:13,286
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1174
00:50:13,287 --> 00:50:16,089
Okay, boys. I'm possibly
meeting Jay Z and/or Beyoncé,

1175
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,123
and I'm in a blouse.

1176
00:50:17,124 --> 00:50:19,459
Wear it, dude.
It's an improvement.

1177
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:20,460
Not true.

1178
00:50:20,461 --> 00:50:21,895
Big one.

1179
00:50:55,996 --> 00:50:58,765
- I hate eating alone.
- So do I.

1180
00:50:58,766 --> 00:51:00,700
You know, you don't actually
have to keep doing that.

1181
00:51:00,701 --> 00:51:02,969
Oh, force of habit.

1182
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:03,937
Here you go.

1183
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:05,171
Swiped these
from the tech fridge.

1184
00:51:05,172 --> 00:51:06,540
Oh, nice going.

1185
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,341
You want a slice?

1186
00:51:08,342 --> 00:51:10,245
Sure, thanks.

1187
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,613
Cheers.

1188
00:51:13,614 --> 00:51:14,983
Cheers.

1189
00:51:20,554 --> 00:51:22,655
I noticed
a couple hours ago,

1190
00:51:22,656 --> 00:51:25,025
you had a meeting
with another possible CEO.

1191
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:27,460
I saw him arrive.
How'd that go?

1192
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:29,362
It was going well...

1193
00:51:29,363 --> 00:51:30,797
Until he called us...

1194
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:33,634
I believe the term he used
was a "chick site."

1195
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:37,170
And I didn't hear
anything he said after that.

1196
00:51:37,171 --> 00:51:40,106
Apparently, selling clothes
makes us a "chick site."

1197
00:51:40,107 --> 00:51:41,240
I mean, really?

1198
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,642
How is this not legit?

1199
00:51:42,643 --> 00:51:45,445
I couldn't agree more.
I find that surprising.

1200
00:51:45,446 --> 00:51:47,949
Really?
Sexism in business?

1201
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:51,851
So...

1202
00:51:51,852 --> 00:51:54,287
What did you do for work, Ben,
before you retired?

1203
00:51:54,288 --> 00:51:56,690
I was a V.P.
For Dex one.

1204
00:51:56,691 --> 00:51:57,824
Phonebooks?

1205
00:51:57,825 --> 00:51:59,893
Yeah.
I was in charge of printing,

1206
00:51:59,894 --> 00:52:02,362
and before that I ran
sales and advertising.

1207
00:52:02,363 --> 00:52:04,165
Big jobs.

1208
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:08,770
Wasn't this a factory
that used to make phonebooks?

1209
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:14,674
No. What?

1210
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:16,710
- Yeah.
- What?

1211
00:52:16,711 --> 00:52:19,579
This is
where you worked?

1212
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,950
For almost 40 years.

1213
00:52:24,418 --> 00:52:25,786
Yeah.

1214
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:28,555
For twenty-some years
I sat right by that window.

1215
00:52:28,556 --> 00:52:30,657
That was my office.

1216
00:52:30,658 --> 00:52:33,826
It was
a few steps up back then.

1217
00:52:33,827 --> 00:52:36,596
We'd look out
over the whole factory.

1218
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:38,131
Our printing presses
were in that corner.

1219
00:52:38,132 --> 00:52:40,266
That's why the floor dips
back there.

1220
00:52:40,267 --> 00:52:41,768
No way.

1221
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:43,570
I know everything
about this building.

1222
00:52:43,571 --> 00:52:45,071
Or used to.

1223
00:52:45,072 --> 00:52:47,040
You know the sycamores on
the other side of the building?

1224
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:48,174
- Yeah.
- The big ones?

1225
00:52:48,175 --> 00:52:49,709
Yeah. The big ones.
I love them.

1226
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,146
Yeah. I remember
the day they were planted.

1227
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:57,384
Is it totally weird
being back here?

1228
00:52:57,385 --> 00:52:58,918
Well,
it feels like home.

1229
00:52:58,919 --> 00:53:02,956
It's... Remodeled, but...

1230
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:04,192
Home.

1231
00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:10,931
So you're on Facebook,
huh?

1232
00:53:10,932 --> 00:53:12,532
Well, I've been trying to
figure it out.

1233
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:13,900
I joined
about 10 minutes ago.

1234
00:53:13,901 --> 00:53:16,336
Well, better late than never.

1235
00:53:16,337 --> 00:53:17,670
You want some help?

1236
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:20,740
I'd love some, but, really,
you've got better things to do.

1237
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:23,211
No,
I need a diversion.

1238
00:53:24,778 --> 00:53:26,113
You have a photo of yourself?

1239
00:53:26,114 --> 00:53:28,314
- No. I need one?
- If you want to look up

1240
00:53:28,315 --> 00:53:30,617
all those hotties
from high school, you do.

1241
00:53:30,618 --> 00:53:31,885
Say cheese.

1242
00:53:31,886 --> 00:53:33,153
Cheese.

1243
00:53:35,122 --> 00:53:36,188
That's cute.

1244
00:53:36,189 --> 00:53:39,394
Okay,
I just need to send that to you.

1245
00:53:40,394 --> 00:53:41,961
Uh, all right.

1246
00:53:41,962 --> 00:53:43,797
So there are all these questions
for your profile

1247
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:45,765
that you can answer
if you want to or not.

1248
00:53:45,766 --> 00:53:49,502
Like religious views,
political views...

1249
00:53:49,503 --> 00:53:51,538
People who inspire you...

1250
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:53,840
Jules Ostin.

1251
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:55,174
I'm not trying to
brownnose you,

1252
00:53:55,175 --> 00:53:57,076
but I've been in business
a long time,

1253
00:53:57,077 --> 00:53:59,980
and I've never run across
anyone quite like you.

1254
00:53:59,981 --> 00:54:01,347
You do inspire, Jules.

1255
00:54:01,348 --> 00:54:02,849
I just knew,
at the end of the day,

1256
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:04,351
that a woman
with a glass of wine

1257
00:54:04,352 --> 00:54:06,820
and a laptop
had real shopping potential.

1258
00:54:06,821 --> 00:54:09,623
And if you could actually
promise her things would fit...

1259
00:54:09,624 --> 00:54:10,724
See?
That's what I mean.

1260
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:12,291
Okay.

1261
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:14,761
Mm.
You have a favorite quote?

1262
00:54:14,762 --> 00:54:16,195
I do.

1263
00:54:16,196 --> 00:54:18,231
"You're never wrong
to do the right thing."

1264
00:54:18,232 --> 00:54:20,333
- Who said that, you?
- Yeah.

1265
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:23,636
But I'm pretty sure
Mark Twain said it first.

1266
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:27,107
Okay,
favorite music?

1267
00:54:27,108 --> 00:54:30,243
Uh, geez. Sam Cooke,
one of my all-time favorites.

1268
00:54:30,244 --> 00:54:32,712
Love Miles Davis,
Billie Holiday.

1269
00:54:32,713 --> 00:54:34,381
Oh,
she was great, right?

1270
00:54:34,382 --> 00:54:36,550
I mean,
she could just, like...

1271
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:38,720
- Transport you.
- Oh, yeah.

1272
00:54:39,687 --> 00:54:42,021
Okay, books?

1273
00:54:42,022 --> 00:54:44,691
Love Clancy, Ludlum.

1274
00:54:44,692 --> 00:54:46,326
Crazy about
"Harry Potter."

1275
00:54:46,327 --> 00:54:48,561
- Matt loves "Harry Potter," too.
- Oh, yeah?

1276
00:54:48,562 --> 00:54:50,363
Yeah, like, read them all
the week they came out.

1277
00:54:50,364 --> 00:54:53,900
Wow. Me, too.

1278
00:54:53,901 --> 00:54:56,402
Um, okay, what's
your relationship status?

1279
00:54:56,403 --> 00:54:58,705
Are you married?

1280
00:54:58,706 --> 00:55:00,206
Single?

1281
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:02,775
Widower.

1282
00:55:02,776 --> 00:55:04,846
I'm sorry.

1283
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:10,550
I think we should just
say single, then?

1284
00:55:10,551 --> 00:55:13,186
Yeah.

1285
00:55:13,187 --> 00:55:16,590
Okay, do you know
what you need now?

1286
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:18,759
You need
someone to friend.

1287
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,560
I'll be friends
with the other interns.

1288
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:22,362
They'll show me how to do it
in the morning.

1289
00:55:22,363 --> 00:55:24,730
Well, you...
you can friend me.

1290
00:55:24,731 --> 00:55:26,332
Okay, thank you.

1291
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:27,401
Okay.

1292
00:55:30,804 --> 00:55:32,505
Okay.
Congratulations.

1293
00:55:32,506 --> 00:55:35,207
You are now officially part
of the Facebook generation.

1294
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:38,078
Good deal.

1295
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,146
- Um, you done?
- Yes, thank you.

1296
00:55:40,147 --> 00:55:41,380
Okay.

1297
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,317
Well, I have, uh,
about another hour of work.

1298
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:45,985
You...
you okay with that?

1299
00:55:45,986 --> 00:55:47,522
Of course.

1300
00:55:48,756 --> 00:55:50,423
This was great, Jules.

1301
00:55:50,424 --> 00:55:52,191
Yeah.

1302
00:55:52,192 --> 00:55:56,963
It was nice to have an adult
conversation with an adult man,

1303
00:55:56,964 --> 00:56:00,266
you know what I mean?
Like, not about work.

1304
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:02,602
Not about...

1305
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:04,637
I know what you mean.

1306
00:56:32,065 --> 00:56:34,234
Oh, we're here?

1307
00:56:34,235 --> 00:56:35,335
Yeah.

1308
00:56:35,336 --> 00:56:36,270
Was I snoring?

1309
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:38,371
No, no, no.
Just sleeping.

1310
00:56:38,372 --> 00:56:40,307
Sorry.

1311
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:42,208
My parents
are sleep researchers,

1312
00:56:42,209 --> 00:56:44,110
and they've been studying
my sleep my whole life.

1313
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:46,813
Apparently,
I'm a classic noisy sleeper.

1314
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:48,314
Fun getting to know me,
huh?

1315
00:56:48,315 --> 00:56:50,351
It is.

1316
00:56:52,586 --> 00:56:57,090
I never fall asleep in the car,
so that was actually amazing.

1317
00:56:57,091 --> 00:56:58,524
Apologize for the racket.

1318
00:56:58,525 --> 00:57:00,360
Barely noticed.

1319
00:57:00,361 --> 00:57:03,496
I'll pretend
I believe you.

1320
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:07,233
I love this house.

1321
00:57:07,234 --> 00:57:09,435
It just
looks happy to me.

1322
00:57:09,436 --> 00:57:11,304
Like,
if it was in a kid's book,

1323
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:14,840
it would make you feel good when
you turned the page and saw it.

1324
00:57:14,841 --> 00:57:16,276
You know what I mean?

1325
00:57:16,277 --> 00:57:18,711
I do.

1326
00:57:18,712 --> 00:57:20,448
Well...

1327
00:57:23,784 --> 00:57:25,418
Sayonara.

1328
00:57:25,419 --> 00:57:27,455
Sayonara.

1329
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:41,701
I didn't
hear you come in.

1330
00:57:41,702 --> 00:57:43,736
You know...

1331
00:57:43,737 --> 00:57:46,906
I was thinking...

1332
00:57:46,907 --> 00:57:49,677
We need
some awake time together.

1333
00:58:01,188 --> 00:58:04,390
Yeah, that, too.

1334
00:58:29,516 --> 00:58:30,451
Morning.

1335
00:58:30,452 --> 00:58:32,484
Good morning.
I'm Doris.

1336
00:58:32,485 --> 00:58:34,086
They asked me
to drive you today.

1337
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:35,221
Are you
all set back there?

1338
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:36,689
You got
your seat belt fastened?

1339
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:38,192
What happened to Ben?

1340
00:58:38,195 --> 00:58:41,761
Oh, somebody said
that he got transferred.

1341
00:58:41,762 --> 00:58:45,965
Um, you know the best way
to get back to headquarters?

1342
00:58:47,234 --> 00:58:48,434
- Oh!
- Oh, my!

1343
00:58:48,435 --> 00:58:49,937
Oh, what...

1344
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,207
- Come on!
- Hold your horses, maniac!

1345
00:58:54,407 --> 00:58:56,676
Which way, Hon?

1346
00:58:56,677 --> 00:58:58,110
- I'm all turned around here.
- Doris.

1347
00:58:58,111 --> 00:58:59,579
- Doris! Doris!
- What? What?!

1348
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,714
You told me
to transfer him.

1349
00:59:01,715 --> 00:59:04,483
That was two days ago.
Why didn't you check with me?

1350
00:59:04,484 --> 00:59:06,820
First of all,
that was yesterday.

1351
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:09,422
Well, where is he?
Do you know?

1352
00:59:13,994 --> 00:59:15,629
Thank you.

1353
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:23,002
You must think
I'm demented.

1354
00:59:23,003 --> 00:59:24,336
Not the word I would use,

1355
00:59:24,337 --> 00:59:26,639
but I was a little surprised
when I got the call.

1356
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,809
Jules, I apologize
if I overstepped in some way.

1357
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:32,011
No. No, no, no.
No, please don't apologize.

1358
00:59:32,012 --> 00:59:33,679
You have done
nothing wrong.

1359
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,550
Look, I have a lot going on,
and I'm a very private person.

1360
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:39,119
And at first, I don't know,
I thought

1361
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,221
maybe this wasn't gonna work,
but I was wrong.

1362
00:59:41,222 --> 00:59:42,789
Let me get
one of those.

1363
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:44,057
- No, no, no.
- No.

1364
00:59:44,058 --> 00:59:45,758
Jules, no explanation necessary.
Please.

1365
00:59:45,759 --> 00:59:49,895
No, actually, one is because
I am usually better than this.

1366
00:59:51,665 --> 00:59:54,400
The truth is...

1367
00:59:54,401 --> 00:59:55,834
Something about you
makes me feel calm

1368
00:59:55,835 --> 00:59:59,939
or more centered or something,
and I-I could use that.

1369
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:02,408
Obviously.

1370
01:00:02,409 --> 01:00:06,145
I hope you'll accept my apology
and come back to work for me.

1371
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:07,847
If you want.

1372
01:00:07,848 --> 01:00:09,014
And I'm not just saying this

1373
01:00:09,015 --> 01:00:10,282
because
I screwed up this morning.

1374
01:00:10,283 --> 01:00:12,218
But I was thinking that

1375
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:14,921
I'd like to bring you up to
my area, next to Becky.

1376
01:00:14,922 --> 01:00:18,658
I know you can handle more work.
If you'd like more. I...

1377
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:20,527
Oh, God, I can't tell you
how much I hate

1378
01:00:20,528 --> 01:00:21,895
that I jumped the gun
and I made you feel...

1379
01:00:21,896 --> 01:00:24,530
I'm coming back.
I-I'm happy to come back.

1380
01:00:24,531 --> 01:00:26,332
Excellent.

1381
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:28,368
Can I give you a lift
back to the office?

1382
01:00:28,369 --> 01:00:29,802
Sure, thanks.
Can I take this?

1383
01:00:29,803 --> 01:00:31,604
No.

1384
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,674
Actually,
do you mind driving?

1385
01:00:34,675 --> 01:00:37,278
- I don't technically have a license.
- Sure.

1386
01:00:42,248 --> 01:00:43,683
This is...
this is crazy, Ben.

1387
01:00:43,684 --> 01:00:45,151
Two desks
are not gonna fit in here.

1388
01:00:45,152 --> 01:00:46,619
No, I promise
I'll stay out of your way.

1389
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,821
But it's impossible because
now I don't have room for...

1390
01:00:48,822 --> 01:00:49,989
- hi.
- Hi.

1391
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:51,257
This is good, right?

1392
01:00:51,258 --> 01:00:52,758
I like this arrangement.

1393
01:00:52,759 --> 01:00:55,227
Uh, Becky, I want you to let Ben
give you a hand, okay?

1394
01:00:55,228 --> 01:00:56,596
And CC him
on all my e-mails?

1395
01:00:56,597 --> 01:00:58,097
Did we get
yesterday's numbers?

1396
01:00:58,098 --> 01:01:01,735
Uh, yes, we did.
I saw them here...

1397
01:01:04,204 --> 01:01:05,872
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1398
01:01:05,873 --> 01:01:08,173
And I need to go over the data
on customer purchase patterns.

1399
01:01:08,174 --> 01:01:09,575
Let Ben take a look
at that, too.

1400
01:01:09,576 --> 01:01:11,678
Actually, let Ben
take a look at that first.

1401
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:12,711
Okay.

1402
01:01:12,712 --> 01:01:14,680
Don't worry, Becky.
Backup's good.

1403
01:01:14,681 --> 01:01:16,550
Ping me
when Cameron gets in?

1404
01:01:32,632 --> 01:01:34,235
Hey.

1405
01:01:35,736 --> 01:01:37,003
Becky?

1406
01:01:37,004 --> 01:01:39,405
I've been here nine months, Ben,
and she's never asked me

1407
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:42,575
to take a look at anything
for her ever, okay?

1408
01:01:42,576 --> 01:01:44,310
I hear you.
That's frustrating.

1409
01:01:44,311 --> 01:01:46,445
I mean, totally.
I graduated from penn.

1410
01:01:46,446 --> 01:01:47,880
I have a business degree.

1411
01:01:47,881 --> 01:01:50,582
But I never seem to do
anything right around here.

1412
01:01:50,583 --> 01:01:54,587
And you're like 50 years older
than me and you're deaf.

1413
01:01:54,588 --> 01:01:57,625
I happen to think you do
a lot of things right.

1414
01:01:58,258 --> 01:02:01,828
You do so much.

1415
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:03,929
I know.
I know that.

1416
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:05,365
- Mm-hmm.
- But she doesn't.

1417
01:02:05,366 --> 01:02:09,368
I mean, I bust my ass for her
14 hours a day,

1418
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:11,403
and she never notices.

1419
01:02:11,404 --> 01:02:13,639
Oh. Oh, my God.

1420
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,743
I hate
girls who cry at work.

1421
01:02:16,744 --> 01:02:19,011
How 'bout if you,
just as an experiment,

1422
01:02:19,012 --> 01:02:20,313
try letting me help you.

1423
01:02:20,314 --> 01:02:21,814
A lot of your stress
is gonna be lifted

1424
01:02:21,815 --> 01:02:23,749
once you're out from under
this mountain of worry.

1425
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,285
And maybe you should consider
leaving here at a normal hour

1426
01:02:26,286 --> 01:02:27,487
once in a while.

1427
01:02:27,488 --> 01:02:28,955
See your friends.
Have a little fun.

1428
01:02:28,956 --> 01:02:32,525
Mm-hmm. I can offer
my assistance in this area.

1429
01:02:32,526 --> 01:02:36,095
I would love to,
actually.

1430
01:02:36,096 --> 01:02:40,299
I just don't want her to think
that I can't do my job

1431
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,034
and I need an intern
to help me.

1432
01:02:42,035 --> 01:02:44,137
Okay, you're not gonna
want to hear this,

1433
01:02:44,138 --> 01:02:47,439
but I heard women who sleep
less than seven hours a night

1434
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,008
gain 38% more weight

1435
01:02:49,009 --> 01:02:51,778
than women who sleep
more than seven hours a night.

1436
01:02:51,779 --> 01:02:53,379
What?!

1437
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:55,014
I leave here at 11:00.
I get back at 7:00.

1438
01:02:55,015 --> 01:02:59,017
I sleep like five hours a night,
and now I'm gonna get fat?

1439
01:02:59,018 --> 01:03:01,320
Let's get through this stuff.
Let's do it together.

1440
01:03:01,321 --> 01:03:02,922
Let's clean-slate it.

1441
01:03:02,923 --> 01:03:04,090
Let's just do it.

1442
01:03:04,091 --> 01:03:06,125
- Yes!
- Very nice, St. Louis.

1443
01:03:06,126 --> 01:03:08,728
- Ah, suede jacket in D.C.
- I cannot believe how well
that sweater is doing.

1444
01:03:08,729 --> 01:03:10,062
I'm so happy.

1445
01:03:10,063 --> 01:03:12,765
- Beautiful, Miami! Thank you.
- Oh! Look at Chicago!

1446
01:03:12,766 --> 01:03:14,734
She put the same boots in her
cart as the woman from Houston.

1447
01:03:14,735 --> 01:03:16,636
Okay, let's see
what she does at checkout.

1448
01:03:18,138 --> 01:03:19,938
She's not
buying them either.

1449
01:03:19,939 --> 01:03:21,974
Okay, maybe check the
delivery cost on those boots?

1450
01:03:21,975 --> 01:03:22,975
Mm-hmm.

1451
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:25,644
- Knock-knock.
- Hey.

1452
01:03:25,645 --> 01:03:28,147
Hi. I took a look
at the data purchase patterns.

1453
01:03:28,148 --> 01:03:29,782
Uh, should I come back?

1454
01:03:29,783 --> 01:03:31,684
No, no, come on in.
That was fast.

1455
01:03:31,685 --> 01:03:33,519
Well,
I enlisted Becky's help.

1456
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,255
It seems the most expensive
place you're advertising

1457
01:03:36,256 --> 01:03:39,358
is actually bringing you
the customers who are
spending the least.

1458
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,427
And the channels
you're least investing in

1459
01:03:41,428 --> 01:03:44,730
are adding enormous value
in segments that currently
appear to have low value

1460
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:47,766
but actually have
the highest spending potential.

1461
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:51,069
That's what I could tell
so far.

1462
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,606
Oh, Ben. Can you, like,
deal with that for me?

1463
01:03:53,607 --> 01:03:54,773
Maybe come up with
a better plan?

1464
01:03:54,774 --> 01:03:56,342
I mean,
if you have the time?

1465
01:03:56,343 --> 01:03:57,878
Happy to.

1466
01:03:58,845 --> 01:04:01,046
The man spent 40 years
in business.

1467
01:04:01,047 --> 01:04:02,281
Yeah, no, I get it.

1468
01:04:02,282 --> 01:04:04,049
And, Jules, Becky
was a huge help in this.

1469
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:06,118
You know she has
a business degree from PENN?

1470
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:07,519
I know.

1471
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,324
I mean, I forgot,
but I know.

1472
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:16,562
I'll say something
to her.

1473
01:04:16,563 --> 01:04:18,097
That would be very nice.

1474
01:04:18,098 --> 01:04:20,767
Hey. How's it goin' up here
in first-class?

1475
01:04:20,768 --> 01:04:23,202
Busy. I see
you found an apartment.

1476
01:04:23,203 --> 01:04:24,303
No.

1477
01:04:24,304 --> 01:04:25,505
My two weeks are up.

1478
01:04:25,506 --> 01:04:26,972
I'm movin' in
with my cousin.

1479
01:04:26,973 --> 01:04:27,941
Excellent.

1480
01:04:27,942 --> 01:04:29,374
In Philadelphia.

1481
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:30,609
- Davis.
- What?

1482
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,545
I'll get there by 11:00,
leave at 5:00.

1483
01:04:32,546 --> 01:04:34,079
It's cool.
I can handle it.

1484
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,216
You know, I feel like
everybody's uncle around here.

1485
01:04:37,217 --> 01:04:38,417
Yeah, why is that?

1486
01:04:38,418 --> 01:04:39,686
Because
I'm gonna save your ass,

1487
01:04:39,687 --> 01:04:41,754
and I'm gonna put you up
for a few weeks.

1488
01:04:41,755 --> 01:04:42,555
Obviously.

1489
01:04:42,556 --> 01:04:43,956
Ben, thank you.

1490
01:04:43,957 --> 01:04:45,658
Mwah!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1491
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:47,761
Okay. Okay.
Easy, fella.

1492
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:53,199
I like that you do
the throw pillow thing.

1493
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,401
I was married
for a very long time.

1494
01:04:55,402 --> 01:04:57,469
Mm.

1495
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,505
Whoa.
Is this your closet?

1496
01:05:00,506 --> 01:05:03,409
Busy man about town.

1497
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:04,977
What's in
all these drawers?

1498
01:05:04,978 --> 01:05:08,013
Boxers, t-shirts,
pocket squares, handkerchiefs.

1499
01:05:08,014 --> 01:05:09,949
Okay, what's the deal
with the handkerchief?

1500
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:11,550
That one
I just don't get at all.

1501
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:12,919
Okay. It's essential.

1502
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,220
That your generation
doesn't know that is criminal.

1503
01:05:15,221 --> 01:05:18,190
The best reason to carry
a handkerchief is to lend it.

1504
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:19,992
Ask Jason about this.

1505
01:05:19,993 --> 01:05:21,294
Women cry, Davis.

1506
01:05:21,295 --> 01:05:22,628
We carry it for them.

1507
01:05:22,629 --> 01:05:25,063
One of the last vestiges
of the Chivalrous Gent.

1508
01:05:25,064 --> 01:05:26,932
Oh. Well, then
it's different than a po...

1509
01:05:26,933 --> 01:05:28,501
I know you want to hang,
but I...

1510
01:05:28,502 --> 01:05:30,969
I have to get some sleep, kid.
I'm pooped.

1511
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,139
Good night, Ben.

1512
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,008
Thanks again.

1513
01:05:36,843 --> 01:05:39,745
Will you wake me in the morning
or is that too much to ask?

1514
01:05:39,746 --> 01:05:41,614
- My parents always...
- too much.

1515
01:05:41,615 --> 01:05:44,150
Understood. I'll just
set an alarm on my phone.

1516
01:05:44,151 --> 01:05:46,886
I hope I can hear it.
I'm such a deep sleeper.

1517
01:05:46,887 --> 01:05:48,887
Oh, my God.
I'll wake you.

1518
01:05:48,888 --> 01:05:50,189
Thank you!

1519
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:52,524
Love you!
Not kidding!

1520
01:05:52,525 --> 01:05:55,394
I love you, too.
Now go to bed.

1521
01:05:55,395 --> 01:05:57,463
Here's some more berries,
guys.

1522
01:05:57,464 --> 01:06:00,199
Ben, can you pour me
more syrup, please?

1523
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,533
Sure can.

1524
01:06:01,534 --> 01:06:03,402
There you go.

1525
01:06:03,403 --> 01:06:04,871
Perfect.
Good job.

1526
01:06:04,872 --> 01:06:06,272
Oh, thanks.

1527
01:06:06,273 --> 01:06:10,676
Oh, boy. Okay, so, this really
big CEO named Townsend,

1528
01:06:10,677 --> 01:06:12,077
the one everyone said would
never be interested in us

1529
01:06:12,078 --> 01:06:13,679
because we weren't
big enough for him?

1530
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,047
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

1531
01:06:16,616 --> 01:06:19,218
We're like
your sister wives.

1532
01:06:19,219 --> 01:06:22,354
Well, we just found out
he's beyond interested.

1533
01:06:22,355 --> 01:06:24,090
Exciting.

1534
01:06:24,091 --> 01:06:25,925
Yeah.

1535
01:06:25,926 --> 01:06:26,992
Maybe.

1536
01:06:26,993 --> 01:06:28,594
Everyone's flipping out
about it,

1537
01:06:28,595 --> 01:06:30,630
but you know
I'm still on the fence at best.

1538
01:06:30,631 --> 01:06:31,998
Anyway,
the only thing is,

1539
01:06:31,999 --> 01:06:33,599
I have to go to San Francisco
to meet him.

1540
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,934
- He can't come here.
- When do you have to go?

1541
01:06:35,935 --> 01:06:38,437
The only day he can meet
is next Thursday.

1542
01:06:38,438 --> 01:06:39,805
Do you want to come?

1543
01:06:39,806 --> 01:06:41,507
Maybe
we can stay the weekend?

1544
01:06:41,508 --> 01:06:44,744
Oh, that sounds awesome.
Um...

1545
01:06:44,745 --> 01:06:47,313
Oh, Thursday I can't.

1546
01:06:47,314 --> 01:06:48,948
Paige is snack leader
at school,

1547
01:06:48,949 --> 01:06:50,615
and I'm supposed to be
in the class with her.

1548
01:06:50,616 --> 01:06:52,451
- It's kind of a big deal.
- Right.

1549
01:06:52,452 --> 01:06:54,219
Yeah,
it's a really big deal.

1550
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,055
No, I know, sweetie.
I'm sorry. I forgot.

1551
01:06:56,056 --> 01:06:58,958
Uh,
maybe Ben could go with you.

1552
01:06:58,959 --> 01:07:01,860
Yeah,
that's a good idea.

1553
01:07:01,861 --> 01:07:03,762
Guys,
Ben has a life.

1554
01:07:03,763 --> 01:07:05,130
Uh, not really.

1555
01:07:05,131 --> 01:07:06,899
Not one that takes me
to San Francisco.

1556
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,235
If you want the company,
I'd love to go.

1557
01:07:09,236 --> 01:07:10,303
Really?

1558
01:07:10,304 --> 01:07:12,572
Definitely.

1559
01:07:12,573 --> 01:07:13,873
- Guess what, Ben?
- Yes?

1560
01:07:13,874 --> 01:07:16,075
Today,
my Dad's gonna be Ariel.

1561
01:07:16,076 --> 01:07:17,176
It's his turn.

1562
01:07:17,177 --> 01:07:19,912
- Oh, that's good, right?
- Really good.

1563
01:07:19,913 --> 01:07:22,014
You guys think
finding a CEO is a big deal?

1564
01:07:22,015 --> 01:07:25,084
Here, the big negotiation
is who gets to be Ariel

1565
01:07:25,085 --> 01:07:27,152
when we're playing
"Little Mermaid."

1566
01:07:27,153 --> 01:07:29,321
And for the record,
it's never been my turn.

1567
01:07:29,322 --> 01:07:30,456
Mnh-mnh.

1568
01:07:30,457 --> 01:07:32,057
So this is huge for me.
I'm excited.

1569
01:07:32,058 --> 01:07:34,695
I get to comb my hair with a fork...

1570
01:07:34,698 --> 01:07:36,996
...play with Gadgets and Gizmos aplenty.

1571
01:07:36,997 --> 01:07:38,731
Daddy!

1572
01:07:38,732 --> 01:07:40,098
This is Jules.

1573
01:07:40,099 --> 01:07:41,901
So, guys, how long
till we get it fixed?

1574
01:07:41,902 --> 01:07:44,470
I mean, if you can't zoom in,
you probably won't buy.

1575
01:07:44,471 --> 01:07:47,339
Yeah, the first couple
hours are already down 23%.

1576
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:48,708
- Oh, boy.
- Okay.

1577
01:07:48,709 --> 01:07:50,543
- I will be there in like...
- Two minutes.

1578
01:07:50,544 --> 01:07:52,712
- ...two minutes.
- We're on it.

1579
01:07:52,713 --> 01:07:55,114
Ben, do you have the info
on friends shopping together?

1580
01:07:55,916 --> 01:07:57,849
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1581
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,985
- This is Jules.
- What's wrong?

1582
01:07:59,986 --> 01:08:01,119
Oh, Mom, hi.

1583
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,821
Um, I just found out
that the zoom link...

1584
01:08:02,822 --> 01:08:04,990
um, the button that you click on
to zoom in on a photo,

1585
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,693
- isn't working.
- That doesn't sound like such a big deal.

1586
01:08:07,694 --> 01:08:09,328
Well, actually, it is.
Um...

1587
01:08:09,329 --> 01:08:13,165
It's what people use to get
a closer look at what...

1588
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:14,533
everybody zooms in.

1589
01:08:14,534 --> 01:08:17,102
I guess I don't go to your
website enough to know that.

1590
01:08:22,809 --> 01:08:24,710
Oh, typing and ringing.

1591
01:08:24,711 --> 01:08:26,245
Yeah, sorry.
Oh, it's the warehouse.

1592
01:08:26,246 --> 01:08:27,713
Mom, I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?

1593
01:08:27,714 --> 01:08:29,414
- No need.
- Okay, love you.

1594
01:08:29,415 --> 01:08:30,582
Yep.

1595
01:08:30,583 --> 01:08:33,418
Who says "yep"
to "I love you"?

1596
01:08:38,392 --> 01:08:39,658
Hi, Alonzo.

1597
01:08:39,659 --> 01:08:40,659
Hi, Jules.

1598
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,927
Not good news.

1599
01:08:41,928 --> 01:08:43,529
What? Okay.
Lay it on me.

1600
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:46,231
In a routine check
by the sanitation department,

1601
01:08:46,232 --> 01:08:47,599
they found one bedbug.

1602
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,835
- No.
- Unfortunately, yes.

1603
01:08:49,836 --> 01:08:52,004
We sent out 4,800 boxes
yesterday.

1604
01:08:52,005 --> 01:08:54,206
We have to get them all back,
shut down the warehouse...

1605
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:55,741
- Ugh.
- ...Spray for bedbugs,

1606
01:08:55,742 --> 01:08:57,576
then we can start shipping
again.

1607
01:08:57,577 --> 01:08:58,744
- Nightmare.
- Nightmare.

1608
01:08:58,745 --> 01:08:59,911
Okay, here we are.

1609
01:08:59,912 --> 01:09:01,949
Okay,
let me just finish this e-mail.

1610
01:09:20,466 --> 01:09:22,100
No!

1611
01:09:22,101 --> 01:09:23,235
No.

1612
01:09:23,236 --> 01:09:24,304
No, no, no.

1613
01:09:32,011 --> 01:09:34,046
Hey, guys.
Thanks for coming.

1614
01:09:34,047 --> 01:09:35,380
I know the zoom is broken,

1615
01:09:35,381 --> 01:09:36,848
and I don't mean to
pull anyone off of that,

1616
01:09:36,849 --> 01:09:38,517
but I need a favor.

1617
01:09:38,518 --> 01:09:40,685
I accidentally sent an e-mail
to the wrong person,

1618
01:09:40,686 --> 01:09:42,421
and she's at work
right now.

1619
01:09:42,422 --> 01:09:44,022
And I know she doesn't check
her personal e-mail

1620
01:09:44,023 --> 01:09:45,557
until she gets home
at 5:30.

1621
01:09:45,558 --> 01:09:47,426
So I have until then
to figure out how to delete it.

1622
01:09:47,427 --> 01:09:50,329
Because if this person sees
this e-mail, it'll be horrible.

1623
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:52,898
And on top of that,
she has a minor heart condition.

1624
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:54,933
I think this could
possibly be not good for that.

1625
01:09:54,934 --> 01:09:58,704
So I am counting on
your good graces and brilliance

1626
01:09:58,705 --> 01:10:00,806
to figure out
a way to save my ass.

1627
01:10:00,807 --> 01:10:02,540
Truthfully, Jules,
it's pretty impossible

1628
01:10:02,541 --> 01:10:03,909
to hack into a server.

1629
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,644
Techie #2: And you don't
know her password?

1630
01:10:05,645 --> 01:10:07,045
No idea.

1631
01:10:07,046 --> 01:10:09,214
Jules, I think there's only
one thing we can do.

1632
01:10:09,215 --> 01:10:10,782
What? Tell me.
I'm dying.

1633
01:10:10,783 --> 01:10:12,284
Me and the boys take off,

1634
01:10:12,285 --> 01:10:15,153
we break into your Mom's house,
and we steal her computer.

1635
01:10:15,154 --> 01:10:17,689
Break into her house
and steal the computer?

1636
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:19,159
Are you kidding me?

1637
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,194
That's freaking genius.

1638
01:10:22,195 --> 01:10:25,464
You will reach your destination

1639
01:10:25,465 --> 01:10:27,432
in 300 yards.

1640
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:31,370
Little does GPS lady know
she is an accomplice to a crime.

1641
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:33,505
The woman has a heart condition.
Think of it as a good deed.

1642
01:10:33,506 --> 01:10:36,141
I never thought you'd be a bad
influence on me, Whittaker.

1643
01:10:36,142 --> 01:10:38,710
Oh, relax, fellas. This is
gonna be a piece of cake.

1644
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:40,045
The key
is under a flowerpot.

1645
01:10:40,046 --> 01:10:42,080
We go in, we delete,
we disappear.

1646
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:43,382
She doesn't have an alarm,
right?

1647
01:10:43,383 --> 01:10:44,583
Nope.
She does not.

1648
01:10:44,584 --> 01:10:46,718
What if there's, like,
a password on the e-mail? Hmm?

1649
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:48,220
Then
we take the computer.

1650
01:10:48,221 --> 01:10:51,022
Jules said she'd buy her
a new one, so it's a win-win.

1651
01:10:51,023 --> 01:10:54,259
You will reach your destination
in 100 yards.

1652
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:55,761
This is like
an "Oceans" movie.

1653
01:10:55,762 --> 01:10:57,762
Ben's the old guy
with the big glasses.

1654
01:10:57,763 --> 01:10:59,231
His name is Elliott Gould.

1655
01:10:59,232 --> 01:11:01,434
- Yeah, and, Jason, you're Clooney.
- Thank you.

1656
01:11:01,435 --> 01:11:03,569
And I'll be Matt Damon
'cause I'm kind of an outsider.

1657
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:04,870
Yeah, definitely.
Who am I?

1658
01:11:04,871 --> 01:11:06,538
Uh, you are
Ben Affleck's brother.

1659
01:11:06,539 --> 01:11:08,074
Well,
why aren't I Brad Pitt?

1660
01:11:08,075 --> 01:11:11,076
I think that's kind of
self-explanatory.

1661
01:11:20,753 --> 01:11:22,054
- Okay, Clooney.
- Thank you.

1662
01:11:22,055 --> 01:11:23,455
You're behind the wheel.

1663
01:11:23,456 --> 01:11:24,724
Park on the street.

1664
01:11:24,725 --> 01:11:26,458
Keep the engine running,
your eyes open.

1665
01:11:26,459 --> 01:11:29,160
Damon, Affleck's brother,
you're with me.

1666
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:30,731
All right,
let's do this.

1667
01:11:32,099 --> 01:11:34,935
Remember,
the key's under the flowerpot.

1668
01:11:52,485 --> 01:11:53,719
Oh, no.

1669
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,121
Oh, great plan so far.
Oh, my God.

1670
01:11:56,122 --> 01:11:58,090
- Lewis, get Becky.
- If we don't know the code,

1671
01:11:58,091 --> 01:11:59,791
this is gonna turn into an alarm
in 60 seconds.

1672
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:01,393
Becky, put Jules on.

1673
01:12:01,394 --> 01:12:03,162
She put me on hold.
What is wrong with that girl?

1674
01:12:03,163 --> 01:12:05,831
This is so not good.
What are we supposed to do, Ben?

1675
01:12:05,832 --> 01:12:06,998
- What are we supposed...
- stop eating!

1676
01:12:06,999 --> 01:12:08,133
- Uh-huh!
- Go look for the computer!

1677
01:12:08,134 --> 01:12:09,735
Right now!
Go! Go! Go!

1678
01:12:09,736 --> 01:12:11,169
No! Separately!
Separate...

1679
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:12,838
Ben.
Ben, you there?

1680
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:14,974
Becky, don't screw around.
Put Jules on. It's an emergency.

1681
01:12:14,975 --> 01:12:17,409
- She's in a meeting.
- Interrupt her.

1682
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,378
Ben, what's up?

1683
01:12:18,379 --> 01:12:20,078
Jules,
your mother has an alarm.

1684
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:21,714
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.

1685
01:12:21,715 --> 01:12:23,749
I'm in her kitchen. It's about
to go off. What's her code?

1686
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:25,617
I have no idea.
Ben, listen to me.

1687
01:12:25,618 --> 01:12:26,885
I know this woman.

1688
01:12:26,886 --> 01:12:28,220
That is a fake alarm
that she bought

1689
01:12:28,221 --> 01:12:29,454
off of some infomercial
or something, okay?

1690
01:12:29,455 --> 01:12:30,989
It's not real.
It's not connected.

1691
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:32,458
It's just to
scare off burglars.

1692
01:12:32,459 --> 01:12:34,193
She says it's fake.
It's just to scare off burglars.

1693
01:12:34,194 --> 01:12:36,027
Oh, well,
it's doing a good job.

1694
01:12:36,028 --> 01:12:38,164
Listen, my parents would never
pay for an alarm, okay?

1695
01:12:38,165 --> 01:12:39,631
They're the cheapest people
in America.

1696
01:12:39,632 --> 01:12:41,767
Okay, well, it hasn't
turned into an alarm yet.

1697
01:12:41,768 --> 01:12:43,969
- It's still beeping.
- That's 'cause it's a fake.

1698
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:45,604
Trust me on this one.
Have you found the computer?

1699
01:12:45,605 --> 01:12:46,905
It's not down here.

1700
01:12:51,511 --> 01:12:53,513
Lewis, go in there.
Davis, in there.

1701
01:12:56,115 --> 01:12:58,416
- Found it!
- Got it! What?

1702
01:12:58,417 --> 01:13:00,385
We found two. Which one is hers?
The white one or the silver one?

1703
01:13:00,386 --> 01:13:02,120
The white one
or the silver one?

1704
01:13:02,121 --> 01:13:03,388
The white one or the silver one?
White one or the silver one?

1705
01:13:03,389 --> 01:13:04,857
- Your Mom's computer?
- Yes.

1706
01:13:04,858 --> 01:13:06,058
It's white.
I got it fixed for her once.

1707
01:13:06,059 --> 01:13:07,626
- I am positive.
- The white one!

1708
01:13:07,627 --> 01:13:09,162
White.

1709
01:13:12,799 --> 01:13:14,532
Oh, my God.

1710
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:17,102
I knew there was no such thing
as a fake alarm!

1711
01:13:17,103 --> 01:13:18,837
We're gonna get arrested!
I knew it!

1712
01:13:18,838 --> 01:13:20,172
That's it! We're done!

1713
01:13:20,173 --> 01:13:22,073
Our fingerprints
are all over this place!

1714
01:13:22,074 --> 01:13:23,442
Ben,
do you see the e-mail?

1715
01:13:23,443 --> 01:13:25,577
- Not yet.
- Double-time it, dude.

1716
01:13:25,578 --> 01:13:27,879
Here, let me.

1717
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,248
Found it!

1718
01:13:29,249 --> 01:13:31,250
"Why is my mother
always such a raging bitch?"

1719
01:13:31,251 --> 01:13:33,151
Subject...
"she's a terrorist."

1720
01:13:33,152 --> 01:13:34,620
Yes! Delete it!

1721
01:13:34,621 --> 01:13:35,720
Gone.

1722
01:13:35,721 --> 01:13:37,090
Now from the trash!

1723
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:39,958
Got it.

1724
01:13:41,828 --> 01:13:42,928
Davis, where'd you find this?

1725
01:13:42,929 --> 01:13:44,029
Under the bed, right side.

1726
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:45,463
Which right side?

1727
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:47,599
Right side facing the bed!
Oh, my God! My life is over!

1728
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,135
I'm gonna be a felon and
I have not committed a crime!

1729
01:13:50,136 --> 01:13:51,403
Davis.
Davis, pull it together.

1730
01:13:51,404 --> 01:13:53,105
Can't you hear
how far away that is?

1731
01:13:53,106 --> 01:13:54,706
We've got at least 30 seconds
until they're here.

1732
01:13:54,707 --> 01:13:56,408
How am I gonna
explain this to my parents?

1733
01:13:56,409 --> 01:13:57,809
Oh, my God.
My lisp is back!

1734
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,478
- 20 seconds.
- Oh!

1735
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:01,214

01:14:52,131 --> 01:14:53,599
I didn't, actually.

1763
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,433
I'm sure my blood pressure
was through the roof.

1764
01:14:55,434 --> 01:14:57,335
But it was worth it.
Good times!

1765
01:14:58,422 --> 01:14:59,505
Guys, I can't...

1766
01:14:59,506 --> 01:15:02,474
I literally can't thank you
enough for what you just did.

1767
01:15:02,475 --> 01:15:06,511
It was so above and beyond
and brave and loyal.

1768
01:15:06,512 --> 01:15:08,213
I am indebted to you
forever.

1769
01:15:08,214 --> 01:15:09,615
- No, you're not.
- Well, you're very welcome.

1770
01:15:09,616 --> 01:15:10,782
You know...

1771
01:15:10,783 --> 01:15:13,552
Takes a team,
but it's done.

1772
01:15:13,553 --> 01:15:16,388
- All taken care of.
- Okay.

1773
01:15:16,389 --> 01:15:18,390
I'm gonna have another.
Anybody else?

1774
01:15:18,391 --> 01:15:19,724
- I would love that.
- Yeah, let's do that.

1775
01:15:19,725 --> 01:15:22,627
Yeah. But could I just get
a half this time?

1776
01:15:22,628 --> 01:15:23,729
I'll take his half.

1777
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:25,231
We'll all
have doubles.

1778
01:15:26,632 --> 01:15:29,301
N-No, it's okay. I can drink.
It's a thing about me.

1779
01:15:29,302 --> 01:15:30,602
Now, what are your names,
again?

1780
01:15:30,603 --> 01:15:32,070
I never
want to not know you.

1781
01:15:32,071 --> 01:15:33,439
I'm Jason.

1782
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,540
I've worked for you
for like a year.

1783
01:15:35,541 --> 01:15:37,442
I've delivered things
to your home.

1784
01:15:37,443 --> 01:15:38,744
I met Matt
a bunch of times.

1785
01:15:38,745 --> 01:15:40,712
I've tied your daughter's shoe
before.

1786
01:15:40,713 --> 01:15:42,848
I... I know who you are.
I'm just terrible with names.

1787
01:15:42,849 --> 01:15:44,583
It's all right.
It's Jason.

1788
01:15:44,584 --> 01:15:45,617
You're new, right?

1789
01:15:45,618 --> 01:15:46,918
Yeah.
I'm Davis.

1790
01:15:46,919 --> 01:15:48,520
I started work
the same day as Ben.

1791
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:50,655
We're pretty much besties,
and I'm his mentee.

1792
01:15:50,656 --> 01:15:52,859
- Oh.
- He gave me this tie, for example.

1793
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:54,359
It was his.
It's vintage.

1794
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,227
- "Vintage."
- I like it.

1795
01:15:56,228 --> 01:15:57,563
I like men in ties.

1796
01:15:57,564 --> 01:15:59,464
- And, you're Lewis.
- Yes.

1797
01:15:59,465 --> 01:16:01,166
Yeah, I could hear a little bit
over the phone.

1798
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:02,634
You were very cool
under pressure.

1799
01:16:02,635 --> 01:16:05,036
Well, it was my first heist.
I tried to be chill.

1800
01:16:05,037 --> 01:16:06,137
Thanks for noticing.

1801
01:16:06,138 --> 01:16:07,940
Salut.

1802
01:16:07,941 --> 01:16:09,074
- Mm!
- Whoo!

1803
01:16:09,075 --> 01:16:11,676
Boys, what can I say...

1804
01:16:11,677 --> 01:16:12,711
I'm sorry.

1805
01:16:12,712 --> 01:16:14,446
I didn't mean
to call you "boys."

1806
01:16:14,447 --> 01:16:16,281
Nobody calls men
"men" anymore.

1807
01:16:16,282 --> 01:16:17,549
Have you noticed?

1808
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:19,150
Women went from "girls"
to "women."

1809
01:16:19,151 --> 01:16:20,585
Men went from "men"
to "boys"?

1810
01:16:20,586 --> 01:16:23,088
This is a problem
in the big picture.

1811
01:16:23,089 --> 01:16:25,290
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1812
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:26,825
I'm gonna have another.

1813
01:16:26,826 --> 01:16:28,226
Another?
You sure about that?

1814
01:16:28,227 --> 01:16:30,796
Yep. Okay,
here's my theory about this.

1815
01:16:30,797 --> 01:16:33,565
We all grew up during the
"take your daughter to work day" thing, right?

1816
01:16:33,566 --> 01:16:34,933
Mm-hmm.

1817
01:16:34,934 --> 01:16:38,236
So we were always told we could
be anything, do anything.

1818
01:16:38,237 --> 01:16:41,139
And I think guys got,
maybe not left behind,

1819
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,840
but not quite as nurtured,
you know?

1820
01:16:42,841 --> 01:16:46,044
I mean, like, we were the
generation of "you go, girl."

1821
01:16:46,045 --> 01:16:47,846
We had Oprah.

1822
01:16:47,847 --> 01:16:51,183
And I wonder sometimes
how guys fit in, you know?

1823
01:16:51,184 --> 01:16:52,718
They still seem to be
trying to figure it out.

1824
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,452
They're still dressing
like little boys.

1825
01:16:54,453 --> 01:16:56,087
They're still playing
video games.

1826
01:16:56,088 --> 01:16:57,889
Well, they've gotten great.
So...

1827
01:16:57,890 --> 01:16:59,758
I love video games.

1828
01:16:59,759 --> 01:17:01,259
Oh, boy.

1829
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,495
How, in one generation,
have men gone from

1830
01:17:03,496 --> 01:17:07,500
guys like Jack Nicholson
and Harrison Ford to...

1831
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:12,871
Take Ben, here.

1832
01:17:12,872 --> 01:17:14,840
A dying breed.
You know?

1833
01:17:14,841 --> 01:17:16,241
Look and learn, boys,

1834
01:17:16,242 --> 01:17:18,576
because if you ask me,
this is what cool is.

1835
01:17:18,577 --> 01:17:21,046
Oh, thanks, Ace. You're not
gonna drink anymore, right?

1836
01:17:21,047 --> 01:17:23,181
Calling me "Ace"?

1837
01:17:23,182 --> 01:17:24,883
That is just super cool,
right?

1838
01:17:24,884 --> 01:17:26,184
- Definitely.
- Very cool.

1839
01:17:26,185 --> 01:17:28,987
Okay.
I am officially a little dizzy.

1840
01:17:28,988 --> 01:17:30,822
I apologize for the tirade.

1841
01:17:30,823 --> 01:17:33,358
I am gonna go.

1842
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:37,629
But I am forever in your debt,
gentlemen.

1843
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:40,198
Another word
which is never used anymore.

1844
01:17:40,199 --> 01:17:42,100
Let's bring it back,
shall we?

1845
01:17:42,101 --> 01:17:45,671
- Yes.
- Ben, I'll be ubering home.

1846
01:17:45,672 --> 01:17:47,172
- Thanks again.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1847
01:17:47,173 --> 01:17:48,206
Okay.

1848
01:17:48,207 --> 01:17:50,642
I'm so sorry.

1849
01:17:50,643 --> 01:17:52,176
Don't worry.

1850
01:17:52,177 --> 01:17:54,913
I'm fine now.

1851
01:17:54,914 --> 01:17:56,716
Okay.

1852
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,149
It's okay, it's okay.

1853
01:18:00,753 --> 01:18:03,723
Oh, I haven't done that
since college.

1854
01:18:07,326 --> 01:18:09,528
Thank you.

1855
01:18:09,529 --> 01:18:12,230
Oh, man.

1856
01:18:12,231 --> 01:18:15,000
Very sorry
you had to see that.

1857
01:18:15,001 --> 01:18:16,234
Humiliating.

1858
01:18:16,235 --> 01:18:17,469
It's all good.

1859
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:19,504
You feeling better?

1860
01:18:19,505 --> 01:18:20,872
Yeah.

1861
01:18:20,873 --> 01:18:24,577
Yeah, I forgot you got to eat
before you drink.

1862
01:18:26,579 --> 01:18:27,845
I'm good now.

1863
01:18:27,846 --> 01:18:30,316
Thank you.

1864
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:40,992
I'm leaving
in a minute.

1865
01:18:40,993 --> 01:18:44,562
Just working on making this
the worst possible day for you.

1866
01:18:44,563 --> 01:18:47,467
No, not at all.
You've had a stressful day.

1867
01:18:51,737 --> 01:18:55,840
How is it that you always
manage to say the right thing...

1868
01:18:55,841 --> 01:18:59,077
Do the right thing,
be the right thing?

1869
01:18:59,078 --> 01:19:01,346
It's uncanny.

1870
01:19:01,347 --> 01:19:03,048
You...
you get some rest.

1871
01:19:03,049 --> 01:19:04,348
I will.

1872
01:19:04,349 --> 01:19:06,252
Thanks for everything.

1873
01:19:10,856 --> 01:19:13,358
Oh, and, uh...

1874
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:15,927
Sayonara.

1875
01:19:15,928 --> 01:19:18,630
Absolutely.

1876
01:19:31,877 --> 01:19:33,645
Really so nice of you
to do this.

1877
01:19:33,646 --> 01:19:35,413
Most women would have
just rescheduled.

1878
01:19:35,414 --> 01:19:38,250
Oh, not to worry.
I understand.

1879
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:40,618
It was unexpected.

1880
01:19:40,619 --> 01:19:42,086
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1881
01:19:42,087 --> 01:19:43,523
You're welcome.

1882
01:19:50,963 --> 01:19:53,164
- Hi.
- Oh. Come on in.

1883
01:19:53,165 --> 01:19:55,501
Oh, no, after you.
Go ahead.

1884
01:19:57,904 --> 01:20:01,406
Benji, you brought a date
to a funeral. Unreal.

1885
01:20:01,407 --> 01:20:03,575
We had plans.
Who knew this was gonna happen?

1886
01:20:03,576 --> 01:20:05,710
Well, how do you do?
I'm Miles.

1887
01:20:05,711 --> 01:20:07,012
Hello. Fiona.

1888
01:20:07,013 --> 01:20:08,379
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

1889
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:11,383
Oh, thank you, dear.

1890
01:20:11,384 --> 01:20:13,118
Wowza!

1891
01:20:47,954 --> 01:20:50,288
I never went to
a Shiva before.

1892
01:20:50,289 --> 01:20:51,756
The laughter
was wonderful.

1893
01:20:51,757 --> 01:20:53,525
I don't think
I've ever eaten more.

1894
01:20:53,526 --> 01:20:56,261
I'm not even sure how I left
with a box of cookies.

1895
01:20:56,262 --> 01:20:57,828
Well,
you were a big hit.

1896
01:20:57,829 --> 01:21:00,631
Giving the widow that
back massage... winning move.

1897
01:21:00,632 --> 01:21:02,700
Oh, yeah.
She needed it.

1898
01:21:02,701 --> 01:21:04,269
I definitely think
it's a good idea

1899
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:06,371
to take all first dates
to a funeral.

1900
01:21:06,372 --> 01:21:08,740
Yeah. A real icebreaker,
don't you think?

1901
01:21:09,742 --> 01:21:11,443
I know you're kidding
but, honestly,

1902
01:21:11,444 --> 01:21:13,544
who needs the strain
of the dinner date?

1903
01:21:13,545 --> 01:21:15,714
And the "why aren't you
married?" Conversation.

1904
01:21:15,715 --> 01:21:19,584
At our age it's not even
possible to catch up.

1905
01:21:19,585 --> 01:21:22,755
Well, I can do me
in 10 seconds.

1906
01:21:24,023 --> 01:21:25,625
- You ready?
- Yep.

1907
01:21:25,628 --> 01:21:28,427
Widower,
one son, two grandkids.

1908
01:21:28,428 --> 01:21:30,562
Spent my life
manufacturing phonebooks,

1909
01:21:30,563 --> 01:21:31,996
which no longer
serve a purpose.

1910
01:21:32,999 --> 01:21:34,833
I'm currently working
as an intern,

1911
01:21:34,834 --> 01:21:36,734
having a ball.

1912
01:21:36,735 --> 01:21:40,738
And the best news is, I have
a crush on a girl I met at work.

1913
01:21:40,739 --> 01:21:44,042
I'm sorry
you lost your wife.

1914
01:21:44,043 --> 01:21:45,076
Okay.

1915
01:21:45,077 --> 01:21:46,444
Divorced.

1916
01:21:46,445 --> 01:21:47,945
Three beautiful daughters.

1917
01:21:47,946 --> 01:21:50,915
One grandchild, a boy,
on the way.

1918
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:52,450
I was sick
a few years back.

1919
01:21:52,451 --> 01:21:53,685
I'm not anymore.

1920
01:21:53,686 --> 01:21:56,221
I'm an in-house
e-commerce masseuse.

1921
01:21:56,222 --> 01:21:57,722
Love my job.

1922
01:21:57,723 --> 01:22:02,427
And I finally met a man I
actually want to hang out with.

1923
01:22:02,428 --> 01:22:03,863
Lucky me.

1924
01:22:20,479 --> 01:22:21,680
Morning.

1925
01:22:21,681 --> 01:22:23,481
Hey, buddy.
You don't look so great.

1926
01:22:23,482 --> 01:22:25,117
Yeah, I know.

1927
01:22:25,118 --> 01:22:28,554
But believe me, I look better than I feel.

1928
01:22:28,555 --> 01:22:29,787
Oh, did you see the Yankees
last night?

1929
01:22:29,788 --> 01:22:32,156
- Oh, they were on fire.
- Oh, man.

1930
01:22:32,157 --> 01:22:34,258
Got to get something
in your stomach.

1931
01:22:34,259 --> 01:22:35,693
Honey, honey, honey.

1932
01:22:35,694 --> 01:22:37,729
Just can you please take
one bite before school?

1933
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:39,130
Please?
Just one bite?

1934
01:22:39,131 --> 01:22:41,766
Hey, what's with the waterworks,
little one?

1935
01:22:41,767 --> 01:22:43,034
I just told her that
the sitter's gonna have to

1936
01:22:43,035 --> 01:22:44,502
take her to
Maddie's birthday party

1937
01:22:44,503 --> 01:22:45,770
because
Matt's feeling sick.

1938
01:22:45,771 --> 01:22:49,741
But I don't want to go
with the sitter.

1939
01:22:49,742 --> 01:22:50,876
Ben?

1940
01:22:50,877 --> 01:22:53,211
Can you take me?

1941
01:22:53,212 --> 01:22:54,946
Please?

1942
01:22:54,947 --> 01:22:56,247
Oh, honey?

1943
01:22:56,248 --> 01:22:59,917
I'm so sorry, but Ben's
got to go to work today.

1944
01:23:02,488 --> 01:23:04,355
Jules. Come on.
It'll take an hour.

1945
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:06,192
Let me take her.

1946
01:23:08,895 --> 01:23:10,929
I... I can't believe
we're still going through this.

1947
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:13,832
I'm going the right way.
Please have a little trust.

1948
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:16,000
But the park
where the party is...

1949
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:17,702
Oh. Sorry, Ben.

1950
01:23:17,703 --> 01:23:20,604
Actually, this is it.

1951
01:23:20,605 --> 01:23:22,673
You're like a clone.

1952
01:23:22,674 --> 01:23:25,677
Oh, boy.
This looks like a nice party.

1953
01:23:25,678 --> 01:23:27,779
Yeah, it does.

1954
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,347
So which one is Maddie?

1955
01:23:29,348 --> 01:23:31,549
The one in the pink.

1956
01:23:31,550 --> 01:23:34,053
Okay.
The one in the pink.

1957
01:23:35,721 --> 01:23:38,256
You can go sit with
the other Moms, okay?

1958
01:23:38,257 --> 01:23:40,524
Okay. You want to
give Maddie her present?

1959
01:23:40,525 --> 01:23:41,560
Yeah.

1960
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:42,593
Okay.

1961
01:23:42,594 --> 01:23:45,031
Have fun.

1962
01:23:46,999 --> 01:23:48,100
The other Moms.

1963
01:23:49,368 --> 01:23:50,802
Frep... Freprino
or something.

1964
01:23:50,803 --> 01:23:52,437
Yeah, I know.
I don't know any of them.

1965
01:23:52,438 --> 01:23:54,205
Hi. I'm Ben.

1966
01:23:54,206 --> 01:23:55,273
- Hi. Jane.
- Jane.

1967
01:23:55,274 --> 01:23:56,708
- And Emily.
- Hi, Emily.

1968
01:23:56,709 --> 01:23:58,309
I'm helping Matt and Jules out
today.

1969
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:59,678
Oh, are you Matt's Dad?

1970
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:01,913
No, no.
I work for Jules.

1971
01:24:01,914 --> 01:24:03,147
Oh.

1972
01:24:03,148 --> 01:24:04,716
That's okay?

1973
01:24:04,717 --> 01:24:08,219
I've just heard she's,
you know, kind of tough.

1974
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:10,855
Tough? Jules? Sure.
She's a total badass.

1975
01:24:10,856 --> 01:24:13,658
I guess that's how she became
an Internet sensation.

1976
01:24:13,659 --> 01:24:15,527
Must make you guys proud,
huh?

1977
01:24:15,528 --> 01:24:16,928
One of your own out there
every day,

1978
01:24:16,929 --> 01:24:19,064
crashing the glass ceiling
of the tech world.

1979
01:24:19,065 --> 01:24:22,367
So, bravo, good for her.
Right?

1980
01:24:22,368 --> 01:24:24,368
Y-Yeah.
No, for sure.

1981
01:24:25,805 --> 01:24:27,238
What's up, kiddo?

1982
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:28,607
I don't feel good.

1983
01:24:28,608 --> 01:24:31,442
You don't?
Do you want to sit on my lap?

1984
01:24:31,443 --> 01:24:34,812
You know, if she's sick
she probably shouldn't be here.

1985
01:24:34,813 --> 01:24:37,782
Tough crowd, Paigey.
You want to hit the road?

1986
01:24:37,783 --> 01:24:39,317
Does that mean "leave"?

1987
01:24:39,318 --> 01:24:40,720
'Fraid so.

1988
01:24:42,387 --> 01:24:48,126
I spy with my little eye
something... Blue!

1989
01:24:48,127 --> 01:24:50,261
Is it the car next to us?

1990
01:24:50,262 --> 01:24:51,563
No.

1991
01:24:51,564 --> 01:24:54,298
Is it, um,
that dog leash?

1992
01:24:54,299 --> 01:24:55,867
No.

1993
01:24:55,868 --> 01:24:57,735
Um, is it the sky?

1994
01:24:57,736 --> 01:24:59,503
Yes! You got one.

1995
01:24:59,504 --> 01:25:00,872
Your turn, Ben.

1996
01:25:00,873 --> 01:25:02,439
Okay.

1997
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,942
Oh, I have a good one.

1998
01:25:03,943 --> 01:25:07,478
I spy with my little eye
something green.

1999
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:09,180
Is it that tree?

2000
01:25:09,181 --> 01:25:10,448
Nope.

2001
01:25:10,449 --> 01:25:12,383
Is it that front door?

2002
01:25:12,384 --> 01:25:14,754
Well, it's kind of green.

2003
01:25:30,202 --> 01:25:31,870
Is it, Ben?

2004
01:25:31,871 --> 01:25:34,240
Is it that front door?

2005
01:25:36,775 --> 01:25:39,612
Yeah, it is, honey.
Good girl.

2006
01:26:52,651 --> 01:26:54,887
Thanks so much, Ben.

2007
01:27:10,736 --> 01:27:12,169
Hey,
come on in the kitchen.

2008
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:13,971
Can I get you something
before you hit the road?

2009
01:27:13,972 --> 01:27:16,708
Want a cup of coffee
or a bite to eat?

2010
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:18,242
Uh, I'm good, thanks.

2011
01:27:18,243 --> 01:27:20,945
Okay. How was she?
She give you any trouble?

2012
01:27:20,946 --> 01:27:22,479
She was perfect.

2013
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,648
She wasn't feeling so great
at the party, so we left early,

2014
01:27:24,649 --> 01:27:28,720
and she just fell asleep in the
car, so I let her get a nap in.

2015
01:27:28,721 --> 01:27:30,388
So nice of you.
Thank you.

2016
01:27:31,624 --> 01:27:32,925
Sorry.

2017
01:27:37,062 --> 01:27:39,063
You seem like
you're feeling more with it.

2018
01:27:39,064 --> 01:27:40,898
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Um...

2019
01:27:40,899 --> 01:27:42,901
I guess I just needed
a little downtime.

2020
01:27:42,902 --> 01:27:46,838
You know, or maybe I wasn't even
that sick, I don't know.

2021
01:27:46,839 --> 01:27:49,507
Hey, Ben, I got something
I wanted to ask.

2022
01:27:49,508 --> 01:27:52,409
What's your whole take
on the CEO thing?

2023
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:55,213
I mean, you're more
on the inside than I am.

2024
01:27:55,214 --> 01:27:58,382
I know Jules is trying to
do right by everybody...

2025
01:27:58,383 --> 01:28:00,184
the investors.

2026
01:28:00,185 --> 01:28:01,518
The company.

2027
01:28:01,519 --> 01:28:02,519
You.

2028
01:28:04,122 --> 01:28:05,656
She's got a lot
on her shoulders.

2029
01:28:05,657 --> 01:28:07,893
The pressure
is unbelievable.

2030
01:28:10,196 --> 01:28:14,899
Am I wrong
that I want it to happen?

2031
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,068
I mean,
I-I want what she wants,

2032
01:28:17,069 --> 01:28:19,871
but you know what it's like
around here.

2033
01:28:19,872 --> 01:28:22,841
We don't see her enough,
and maybe this can fix that.

2034
01:28:22,842 --> 01:28:26,145
A CEO's gonna fix
what's going on here, Matt?

2035
01:28:29,281 --> 01:28:32,950
Whatever she decides, I just...
I want it to be good for her.

2036
01:28:32,951 --> 01:28:35,521
I want her to be happy.

2037
01:28:37,355 --> 01:28:38,756
Of course.

2038
01:28:38,757 --> 01:28:41,460
She deserves that.

2039
01:28:42,527 --> 01:28:46,132
Yeah,
she does deserve it.

2040
01:28:53,605 --> 01:28:55,541
Hi, Amy.

2041
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:03,481
Benjamin,
what do you think?

2042
01:29:03,482 --> 01:29:04,715
Found it on ebay.

2043
01:29:04,716 --> 01:29:06,117
You were right.
Total classic.

2044
01:29:06,118 --> 01:29:07,151
It's awesome, kid.

2045
01:29:07,152 --> 01:29:09,653
<i>♪ And many more ♪</i>

2046
01:29:34,046 --> 01:29:35,412
So, how did it go?

2047
01:29:35,413 --> 01:29:37,581
Oh. Well, you have a great kid,
Jules.

2048
01:29:37,582 --> 01:29:38,983
She's adorable.

2049
01:29:38,984 --> 01:29:41,819
Oh, thank you so much
for doing that.

2050
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:44,523
So, you excited about our trip
to San Francisco tomorrow?

2051
01:29:45,925 --> 01:29:48,460
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

2052
01:29:49,594 --> 01:29:51,896
Oh, I hope you don't have
what Matt has.

2053
01:29:51,897 --> 01:29:52,897
I don't.

2054
01:29:52,898 --> 01:29:53,898
You sure?

2055
01:29:53,899 --> 01:29:55,167
Positive.

2056
01:29:56,868 --> 01:29:58,035
What's that?

2057
01:29:58,036 --> 01:29:59,036
Blood pressure.

2058
01:29:59,037 --> 01:30:01,038
I take it every day.

2059
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:02,274
Are you sure
you're okay?

2060
01:30:02,275 --> 01:30:03,507
Yeah.

2061
01:30:03,508 --> 01:30:05,910
You don't look like you.
You're all flushed.

2062
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:07,845
Why don't you go see Fiona,
the masseuse,

2063
01:30:07,846 --> 01:30:09,546
and just chill a little.

2064
01:30:09,547 --> 01:30:10,547
What's up?

2065
01:30:10,548 --> 01:30:12,283
Whoa, Ben, you okay?

2066
01:30:12,284 --> 01:30:15,119
You seem to be
slightly malfunctioning.

2067
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,522
Becky.
Does he look right to you?

2068
01:30:17,523 --> 01:30:19,190
Okay. Thank you.

2069
01:30:19,191 --> 01:30:20,624
I think we're good here.

2070
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:21,959
Got a lot of work to do.

2071
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,727
It's all good.

2072
01:30:23,728 --> 01:30:25,863
Is it his coloring?

2073
01:30:25,864 --> 01:30:26,964
Oh, my God,
you're all nuts.

2074
01:30:26,965 --> 01:30:28,532
I'm 100%.
Let's move on, kids.

2075
01:30:28,533 --> 01:30:30,368
Big day. Lots to do.

2076
01:30:30,369 --> 01:30:32,637
Okay. Ben...

2077
01:30:32,638 --> 01:30:35,006
If I am giving you too much to
do or working you too hard,

2078
01:30:35,007 --> 01:30:37,575
please do not feel that you have
to go with me to San Francisco.

2079
01:30:37,576 --> 01:30:39,844
Jules, people my age
get tired sometimes.

2080
01:30:39,845 --> 01:30:41,312
That's all this is.

2081
01:30:41,313 --> 01:30:42,780
You're tired?

2082
01:30:42,781 --> 01:30:45,301
That's why you haven't looked at
me once since I came over here?

2083
01:30:46,718 --> 01:30:48,254
I'm looking at you.

2084
01:30:50,889 --> 01:30:53,358
Jules.
Cameron's on the phone.

2085
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:54,692
Okay.

2086
01:30:54,693 --> 01:30:57,729
Like, if you don't feel better
tonight or late...

2087
01:30:57,730 --> 01:31:00,331
I'm just saying
I can go by myself, okay?

2088
01:31:00,332 --> 01:31:03,135
I'm a big girl.
I'll be fine.

2089
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:14,478
Okay, seriously?

2090
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:16,047
Ben, what is it?

2091
01:31:16,048 --> 01:31:18,449
You know,
I'm a sensitive man.

2092
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:19,851
People don't
think that about me.

2093
01:31:19,852 --> 01:31:21,252
I don't look it,
but I am.

2094
01:31:21,253 --> 01:31:23,488
Under all this man stuff
that you so admire...

2095
01:31:23,489 --> 01:31:25,091
Mm-hmm.

2096
01:31:25,092 --> 01:31:26,691
...I'm just
a big bowl of mush.

2097
01:31:26,692 --> 01:31:28,626
I know that.

2098
01:31:28,627 --> 01:31:30,229
Okay.

2099
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:33,364
That's it?

2100
01:31:33,365 --> 01:31:35,966
That's what
24 hours of crazy comes to?

2101
01:31:35,967 --> 01:31:38,369
That you're
a sensitive bowl of mush?

2102
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:41,538
Jules.

2103
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:43,309
Ben.

2104
01:31:45,176 --> 01:31:47,211
Jules,
what are we doing here?

2105
01:31:47,212 --> 01:31:49,213
We got the day off.
We're traveling in first-class.

2106
01:31:49,214 --> 01:31:50,848
Let's at least
have a little fun.

2107
01:31:50,849 --> 01:31:53,584
Now, that, I can do.

2108
01:32:20,445 --> 01:32:23,314
Ladies and gentlemen,
as we start our descent,

2109
01:32:23,315 --> 01:32:25,516
please make sure your seat
backs and tray tables

2110
01:32:25,517 --> 01:32:27,184
are in their full,
upright positions

2111
01:32:27,185 --> 01:32:29,420
and all carryon luggage
is stowed

2112
01:32:29,421 --> 01:32:31,455
under the seat
in front of you.

2113
01:32:31,456 --> 01:32:32,657
You okay?

2114
01:32:32,658 --> 01:32:33,691
Yeah.

2115
01:32:33,692 --> 01:32:35,426
Just thinking,
tomorrow I meet the guy

2116
01:32:35,427 --> 01:32:37,328
who may become
my Boss, kind of.

2117
01:32:37,329 --> 01:32:39,330
I mean a lot of people
have Bosses, right?

2118
01:32:39,331 --> 01:32:41,833
- Most people have Bosses.
- Jules, it's simple.

2119
01:32:41,834 --> 01:32:43,801
If you think Townsend
is gonna be good for you

2120
01:32:43,802 --> 01:32:45,602
and good for the company,
then do it.

2121
01:32:45,603 --> 01:32:46,604
And if not...

2122
01:32:46,605 --> 01:32:47,539
Exactly.

2123
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:49,406
Just because
I came all way here...

2124
01:32:49,407 --> 01:32:51,509
Right.
Doesn't mean anything.

2125
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:53,112
I agree.

2126
01:32:54,913 --> 01:32:56,347
Do you think I can take a Xanax

2127
01:32:56,348 --> 01:32:58,549
if I had two glasses of wine
an hour ago?

2128
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:01,120
Well, I'd wait
another couple hours.

2129
01:33:06,291 --> 01:33:09,894
It's a thing I do before I land.
We're good now.

2130
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:22,640
- Jules?
- Yeah.

2131
01:33:22,641 --> 01:33:24,675
- You hear that?
- Uh-huh. I hear it. I'm up.

2132
01:33:42,494 --> 01:33:43,294
Are you okay?

2133
01:33:43,295 --> 01:33:44,528
This alarm going off

2134
01:33:44,529 --> 01:33:46,264
is not a good omen
about this guy.

2135
01:33:46,265 --> 01:33:48,465
- It's a sign, Ben.
- Oh, I'm pretty sure it's not.

2136
01:33:48,466 --> 01:33:50,167
So you haven't
taken a Xanax, yet?

2137
01:33:50,168 --> 01:33:52,469
You told me
to wait a few hours.

2138
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:54,405
You travel
with your own robe?

2139
01:33:54,406 --> 01:33:56,107
Yeah.

2140
01:33:56,108 --> 01:33:57,475
Ladies and gentlemen,

2141
01:33:57,476 --> 01:33:59,643
a smoke alarm went off
in one of the rooms,

2142
01:33:59,644 --> 01:34:01,712
but the problem
has been taken care of.

2143
01:34:01,713 --> 01:34:02,680
Our sincerest apologies.

2144
01:34:02,681 --> 01:34:04,782
Oh, yeah.
100 people, 2 elevators.

2145
01:34:04,783 --> 01:34:07,186
Definitely a sign.

2146
01:34:09,387 --> 01:34:11,055
Well,
thanks for escorting me back.

2147
01:34:11,056 --> 01:34:12,391
Mm-hmm.

2148
01:34:15,894 --> 01:34:18,028
You want to see my room?

2149
01:34:18,029 --> 01:34:19,330
Oh, nice.

2150
01:34:19,331 --> 01:34:21,866
I mean,
do you actually want to come in?

2151
01:34:21,867 --> 01:34:25,569
I have a tea kettle.
We could have tea or...

2152
01:34:27,606 --> 01:34:30,375
I'm ridiculously nervous
about tomorrow.

2153
01:34:34,846 --> 01:34:36,180
You can lie down.

2154
01:34:36,181 --> 01:34:38,317
I know you're tired.
I'll sit in the chair.

2155
01:34:49,961 --> 01:34:51,396
Here you go.

2156
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,001
I thought you were gonna
sit in a chair?

2157
01:34:57,002 --> 01:35:01,173
Please let me be here.
I need to lie down, too.

2158
01:35:02,441 --> 01:35:04,508
We don't have to talk about work
or anything.

2159
01:35:04,509 --> 01:35:08,278
All right.
What should we talk about?

2160
01:35:08,279 --> 01:35:10,582
Marriage?

2161
01:35:13,185 --> 01:35:16,052
Will you tell me
about your wife?

2162
01:35:16,053 --> 01:35:17,721
She was great, right?

2163
01:35:17,722 --> 01:35:19,523
She was.

2164
01:35:19,524 --> 01:35:22,259
Molly was her name.

2165
01:35:22,260 --> 01:35:24,929
She was
a middle-school principal.

2166
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:26,130
Beloved.

2167
01:35:26,131 --> 01:35:27,965
So perfect.

2168
01:35:27,966 --> 01:35:30,434
Long marriage?

2169
01:35:30,435 --> 01:35:32,102
Not long enough.

2170
01:35:32,103 --> 01:35:33,471
42 years.

2171
01:35:33,472 --> 01:35:36,107
Wow.
What was that like?

2172
01:35:36,108 --> 01:35:38,742
You know when people say
they want to grow old together?

2173
01:35:38,743 --> 01:35:41,779
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, we did that.

2174
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:43,080
We met when we were 20.

2175
01:35:43,081 --> 01:35:45,716
Well, I was 20.
She was 19.

2176
01:35:45,717 --> 01:35:49,353
And what was amazing
is she never really changed.

2177
01:35:49,354 --> 01:35:51,922
That's a hard thing
to pull off.

2178
01:35:51,923 --> 01:35:54,291
She handled life
like it was easy.

2179
01:35:54,292 --> 01:35:56,159
Always.

2180
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:59,198
Even when it wasn't.

2181
01:36:00,298 --> 01:36:02,234
God, I envy that.

2182
01:36:04,969 --> 01:36:06,238
Are you hungry?

2183
01:36:08,306 --> 01:36:10,307
We have, um...

2184
01:36:10,308 --> 01:36:13,710
Gummy bears, chocolate chips,
pringles.

2185
01:36:13,711 --> 01:36:14,745
Yup.

2186
01:36:14,746 --> 01:36:17,281
I'm just gonna bring
the whole thing.

2187
01:36:17,282 --> 01:36:20,351
You know those are
like 15 bucks each?

2188
01:36:20,352 --> 01:36:23,086
Benjamin, I run a very big
Internet company.

2189
01:36:23,087 --> 01:36:25,756
Let's go crazy.

2190
01:36:25,757 --> 01:36:27,958
Okay.

2191
01:36:27,959 --> 01:36:29,461
So...

2192
01:36:31,263 --> 01:36:33,597
So...

2193
01:36:33,598 --> 01:36:35,634
Yeah, so...

2194
01:36:37,569 --> 01:36:40,405
I got a weird one
for you.

2195
01:36:43,108 --> 01:36:45,344
Matt is cheating on me.

2196
01:36:46,878 --> 01:36:49,212
Wait a minute.
You know about this?

2197
01:36:49,213 --> 01:36:51,281
What does that mean?

2198
01:36:51,282 --> 01:36:52,918
Wait,
you know about this?

2199
01:36:54,485 --> 01:36:56,420
I saw them together.

2200
01:36:56,421 --> 01:36:58,455
Oh, my God. When?

2201
01:36:58,456 --> 01:37:01,258
Yesterday.

2202
01:37:01,259 --> 01:37:02,692
I'm... I'm sorry.

2203
01:37:02,693 --> 01:37:05,996
I mean, it was an accident
that I saw them, but I did.

2204
01:37:05,997 --> 01:37:08,532
Yesterday.

2205
01:37:08,533 --> 01:37:10,836
Then it is
still going on.

2206
01:37:12,503 --> 01:37:14,338
How long have you known?

2207
01:37:14,339 --> 01:37:17,174
For like 18 days.

2208
01:37:17,175 --> 01:37:19,044
She's a Mom
at Paige's school.

2209
01:37:20,345 --> 01:37:21,778
It's still so hard
for me to grasp.

2210
01:37:21,779 --> 01:37:24,147
I-I was in the kitchen
making sandwiches,

2211
01:37:24,148 --> 01:37:25,649
and his phone was there.

2212
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:26,917
He was upstairs
with Paige,

2213
01:37:26,918 --> 01:37:28,719
and h-he was getting
all these text messages.

2214
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,854
And I don't know why,
but I read them.

2215
01:37:30,855 --> 01:37:33,624
It was not good.

2216
01:37:33,625 --> 01:37:35,325
Does he know you know?

2217
01:37:35,326 --> 01:37:36,694
No.

2218
01:37:36,695 --> 01:37:39,396
'Cause, honestly, I'm...
I'm not ready...

2219
01:37:39,397 --> 01:37:40,798
To deal with it.

2220
01:37:40,799 --> 01:37:43,033
I would like to be
a little less devastated,

2221
01:37:43,034 --> 01:37:44,603
if that is possible.

2222
01:37:45,704 --> 01:37:47,904
It's classic, though,
isn't it?

2223
01:37:47,905 --> 01:37:49,173
The successful wife.

2224
01:37:49,174 --> 01:37:51,107
The husband feels like
his manhood is threatened,

2225
01:37:51,108 --> 01:37:52,843
so he acts out.

2226
01:37:52,844 --> 01:37:56,547
Girlfriend, I guess,
makes him feel more like a man.

2227
01:37:56,548 --> 01:37:59,884
Sometimes I'm not sure
I know how to do that.

2228
01:37:59,885 --> 01:38:01,785
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

2229
01:38:01,786 --> 01:38:04,255
You're not actually taking the
rap for any of this, are you?

2230
01:38:04,256 --> 01:38:06,457
No! No, no.

2231
01:38:06,458 --> 01:38:07,925
He is the one
doing something wrong.

2232
01:38:07,926 --> 01:38:08,959
I get that.

2233
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,727
Monogam-ish
is not what I'm after.

2234
01:38:10,728 --> 01:38:13,931
I-I'm just...
I'm taking a sec...

2235
01:38:13,932 --> 01:38:17,133
And I'm hoping that it's just
a horrible lapse in judgment

2236
01:38:17,134 --> 01:38:18,568
and not, like, love.

2237
01:38:18,569 --> 01:38:21,805
And once
he moves through this,

2238
01:38:21,806 --> 01:38:24,641
we will eventually
be able to be okay again.

2239
01:38:24,642 --> 01:38:26,511
What do you think
about that?

2240
01:38:28,046 --> 01:38:30,514
Clearly you don't think
that's a possible thing.

2241
01:38:30,515 --> 01:38:33,017
- It... it would be unusual.
- I get that.

2242
01:38:33,018 --> 01:38:37,154
I get not everybody
could do that, but...

2243
01:38:37,155 --> 01:38:39,590
Everybody's not us.

2244
01:38:39,591 --> 01:38:42,492
I have faith in us
because...

2245
01:38:42,493 --> 01:38:44,428
I believe
he still loves me.

2246
01:38:44,429 --> 01:38:48,633
And, you know, we've been
going through so much that...

2247
01:38:50,168 --> 01:38:52,803
God, I wish your expressions
weren't so transparent.

2248
01:38:52,804 --> 01:38:56,073
Some couples do survive
these things, you know.

2249
01:38:56,074 --> 01:38:58,141
I googled it... "staying
together after the affair."

2250
01:38:58,142 --> 01:39:00,678
And a lot of couples,
I mean, a lot stay together.

2251
01:39:00,679 --> 01:39:02,513
And anyway,
there is something to be said

2252
01:39:02,514 --> 01:39:03,847
about moving through it

2253
01:39:03,848 --> 01:39:07,351
and focusing on us
and not on the affair.

2254
01:39:07,352 --> 01:39:10,086
I don't want to
give up on him.

2255
01:39:10,087 --> 01:39:13,091
I know him,
and I know he knows better.

2256
01:39:14,425 --> 01:39:16,260
But I am only human,

2257
01:39:16,261 --> 01:39:19,765
and I am so mad at him.

2258
01:39:21,065 --> 01:39:23,134
You know, so much
has happened to us so fast.

2259
01:39:23,135 --> 01:39:25,368
I think...

2260
01:39:25,369 --> 01:39:26,803
Part of me
was even expecting this.

2261
01:39:26,804 --> 01:39:28,839
Like, you know, he was
the more successful one

2262
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,808
- when we started out.
- No, I didn't know that.

2263
01:39:30,809 --> 01:39:33,010
Yeah, he was.
He was a rising star.

2264
01:39:33,011 --> 01:39:35,145
And he bowed out
so that I could do this.

2265
01:39:35,146 --> 01:39:37,314
He was amazing.

2266
01:39:37,315 --> 01:39:39,084
It was all his idea.

2267
01:39:40,152 --> 01:39:41,751
I'm sure that's why
I'm even considering

2268
01:39:41,752 --> 01:39:43,020
this whole CEO thing,

2269
01:39:43,021 --> 01:39:46,423
thinking maybe
someone else coming in

2270
01:39:46,424 --> 01:39:48,225
will help me
get my life back on track.

2271
01:39:48,226 --> 01:39:49,659
Okay, that...
that's it.

2272
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:51,729
I hate to be the feminist here,
between the two of us,

2273
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:54,364
but you should be able to have
a huge career and be who you are

2274
01:39:54,365 --> 01:39:57,100
without having to accept that
your husband is having an affair

2275
01:39:57,101 --> 01:39:58,301
as some kind of payback.

2276
01:39:58,302 --> 01:39:59,469
Right on.

2277
01:39:59,470 --> 01:40:00,470
I mean it.

2278
01:40:00,471 --> 01:40:02,506
Me, too.

2279
01:40:02,507 --> 01:40:03,840
But such is life,
my friend.

2280
01:40:03,841 --> 01:40:05,209
No, it isn't.
Not always.

2281
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:07,177
And I'm not so sure
I'd be so forgiving.

2282
01:40:07,178 --> 01:40:08,679
I am not so forgiving.

2283
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:10,681
I'm saying that I could
potentially be forgiving.

2284
01:40:10,682 --> 01:40:13,383
But don't think that I
don't feel what's going on here.

2285
01:40:13,384 --> 01:40:15,419
It's crushing.

2286
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:17,654
And when I think of Paige...

2287
01:40:17,655 --> 01:40:19,657
Oh, don't.

2288
01:40:19,658 --> 01:40:23,727
Also, if we got divorced,
he'd remarry.

2289
01:40:23,728 --> 01:40:26,765
Maybe not to this girl,
but someone.

2290
01:40:29,467 --> 01:40:31,870
And we both know I'm not easy.

2291
01:40:33,204 --> 01:40:36,706
So I could be, like, single
forever, which means that...

2292
01:40:36,707 --> 01:40:39,076
Forgive me, but this does

2293
01:40:39,077 --> 01:40:41,945
keep me up
in the middle of the night.

2294
01:40:41,946 --> 01:40:43,046
Oh.

2295
01:40:43,047 --> 01:40:44,448
What?

2296
01:40:44,449 --> 01:40:46,983
That I don't want to
be buried alone.

2297
01:40:46,984 --> 01:40:48,385
Paige'll be
with her husband,

2298
01:40:48,386 --> 01:40:49,686
and Matt'll be
with his new family,

2299
01:40:49,687 --> 01:40:51,322
and I will be
buried with strangers.

2300
01:40:51,323 --> 01:40:55,192
I will buried in the strangers
singles section of the cemetery.

2301
01:40:55,193 --> 01:40:58,596
Not that that is a reason
to stay together.

2302
01:40:58,597 --> 01:41:01,899
But it's just, you know,
a scary sidebar.

2303
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,835
Let's take that one
off your plate right now.

2304
01:41:04,836 --> 01:41:06,737
You can be buried with
me and Molly.

2305
01:41:06,738 --> 01:41:09,005
I happen to have space,
okay?

2306
01:41:09,006 --> 01:41:11,541
Oh.

2307
01:41:11,542 --> 01:41:15,045
Thank you so much.
That is...

2308
01:41:15,046 --> 01:41:17,548
And to think
I didn't even want to hire you.

2309
01:41:17,549 --> 01:41:19,816
The one time
I don't have my hanky.

2310
01:41:26,758 --> 01:41:30,260
You want to...

2311
01:41:30,261 --> 01:41:32,562
Watch TV?

2312
01:41:32,563 --> 01:41:34,397
Just for
a few minutes?

2313
01:41:34,398 --> 01:41:36,101
Yeah, sure, I would.

2314
01:41:40,371 --> 01:41:42,272
Even though
the planned merger has...

2315
01:41:44,108 --> 01:41:50,282

2316
01:41:51,683 --> 01:41:58,290

2328

Airport, please.

2329
01:43:43,627 --> 01:43:46,195
So, did we like him?

2330
01:43:46,196 --> 01:43:49,132
He said
all the right things.

2331
01:43:49,133 --> 01:43:52,435
He said that no one knows
about the fit like me.

2332
01:43:52,436 --> 01:43:56,206
That he doesn't want to remove
the soul of the company.

2333
01:43:56,207 --> 01:43:58,175
He said that
he doesn't have a plan.

2334
01:43:58,176 --> 01:44:01,211
He wants to watch us
and see what works.

2335
01:44:01,212 --> 01:44:05,684
He was polite and respectful
and super smart.

2336
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:08,420
And I hired him.

2337
01:44:10,254 --> 01:44:11,421
Seriously?

2338
01:44:11,422 --> 01:44:12,923
Yeah.

2339
01:44:12,924 --> 01:44:14,424
You did it
right in the room?

2340
01:44:14,425 --> 01:44:16,960
He told me to sleep on it
and that we'd talk tomorrow,

2341
01:44:16,961 --> 01:44:19,962
but I said
the job was his.

2342
01:44:19,963 --> 01:44:22,632
We shook hands on it.

2343
01:44:22,633 --> 01:44:27,738
You know if, uh, we disagree,
he's the tiebreaker?

2344
01:44:27,739 --> 01:44:30,340
Of course.
He's the CEO.

2345
01:44:30,341 --> 01:44:33,311
Yeah. Duh.

2346
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:50,460
Hi.

2347
01:44:50,461 --> 01:44:52,197
Hey!

2348
01:44:57,034 --> 01:44:58,434
You smell minty.

2349
01:44:58,435 --> 01:45:00,370
I just made mint tea.

2350
01:45:00,371 --> 01:45:03,140
So...

2351
01:45:03,141 --> 01:45:05,210
Yes? No?

2352
01:45:06,577 --> 01:45:07,877
I did it.

2353
01:45:07,878 --> 01:45:09,713
I liked him.
A lot.

2354
01:45:09,714 --> 01:45:12,649
And, uh...
I offered him the job.

2355
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,751
Wow. Really?

2356
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:16,786
Yeah.

2357
01:45:16,787 --> 01:45:19,256
And you're okay
with it?

2358
01:45:19,257 --> 01:45:21,191
Yeah.

2359
01:45:21,192 --> 01:45:23,795
I think
it'll be good for us.

2360
01:45:31,435 --> 01:45:36,440
Do we have any, like, real
booze, like vodka or something?

2361
01:45:36,441 --> 01:45:37,909
Yeah.

2362
01:45:47,185 --> 01:45:50,720
Did "good for us"
mean...

2363
01:45:50,721 --> 01:45:52,556
About the fit...

2364
01:45:52,557 --> 01:45:55,825
Or us?

2365
01:45:55,826 --> 01:45:58,062
You-and-me us.

2366
01:46:00,865 --> 01:46:03,700
I figure if someone else can
call some of the shots at work,

2367
01:46:03,701 --> 01:46:05,535
then maybe...

2368
01:46:05,536 --> 01:46:08,339
We can get back to
where we were 18 months ago.

2369
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:11,974
They say you can't put the genie
back in the bottle,

2370
01:46:11,975 --> 01:46:14,212
but we can try, right?

2371
01:47:30,854 --> 01:47:32,288
Hey!

2372
01:47:32,289 --> 01:47:33,556
Hi.

2373
01:47:33,557 --> 01:47:34,825
Wait, you live here?

2374
01:47:34,826 --> 01:47:37,260
Yeah, Ben's been putting me up
until I can find a place.

2375
01:47:37,261 --> 01:47:39,062
Oh, should I let him know
that you're here?

2376
01:47:39,063 --> 01:47:40,597
That's okay.
I'll ring.

2377
01:47:40,598 --> 01:47:42,166
Okay.

2378
01:47:47,772 --> 01:47:49,039
Fiona?!

2379
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,607
Jules!

2380
01:47:50,608 --> 01:47:51,976
Come on in.

2381
01:47:55,146 --> 01:47:57,513
I'm just on my way
to work.

2382
01:47:57,514 --> 01:47:59,417
Ben's right in here.

2383
01:48:06,089 --> 01:48:08,092
I'll let you two talk.

2384
01:48:10,862 --> 01:48:12,428
- See you.
- Mm-hmm.

2385
01:48:12,429 --> 01:48:14,263
Hi.

2386
01:48:14,264 --> 01:48:15,431
Wow.

2387
01:48:15,432 --> 01:48:17,601
You and Fiona, huh?
Who knew.

2388
01:48:17,602 --> 01:48:19,169
She's a great gal.

2389
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:22,705
She surprised me last night.
She brought over dinner.

2390
01:48:22,706 --> 01:48:24,274
It's brand-new.

2391
01:48:24,275 --> 01:48:27,544
Congratulations.
I love her.

2392
01:48:27,545 --> 01:48:29,414
Yeah.

2393
01:48:34,718 --> 01:48:37,754
So, I was ready kind of early
this morning, since about 4:00,

2394
01:48:37,755 --> 01:48:40,223
and Matt and Paige left an hour
ago for a field trip

2395
01:48:40,224 --> 01:48:42,292
so I thought I'd come by.
I hope that's okay.

2396
01:48:42,293 --> 01:48:43,860
Yeah.

2397
01:48:45,997 --> 01:48:48,898
I just wanted to say...

2398
01:48:48,899 --> 01:48:51,401
I slept on it.

2399
01:48:51,402 --> 01:48:54,337
I haven't called Townsend
yet, but...

2400
01:48:54,338 --> 01:48:57,542
I still feel like
it's the right thing to do.

2401
01:49:00,044 --> 01:49:02,479
Well...

2402
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,581
I didn't
sleep so well myself.

2403
01:49:05,582 --> 01:49:07,117
Over this?

2404
01:49:07,118 --> 01:49:09,252
You remember the day
I drove you to the warehouse?

2405
01:49:09,253 --> 01:49:11,254
You were giving me the
wrong directions and all that?

2406
01:49:11,255 --> 01:49:12,623
Yeah. I remember.

2407
01:49:13,924 --> 01:49:15,358
Okay, well, I stood in the back,

2408
01:49:15,359 --> 01:49:16,893
and I watched you
show the workers

2409
01:49:16,894 --> 01:49:19,128
how to fold
and box the clothes.

2410
01:49:19,129 --> 01:49:22,431
I knew then
that was why atf was a success.

2411
01:49:22,432 --> 01:49:23,766
No one else
is ever gonna have

2412
01:49:23,767 --> 01:49:27,037
that kind of commitment
to your company, Jules.

2413
01:49:27,038 --> 01:49:29,539
To me, it's pretty simple.

2414
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:32,075
About the fit needs you,
and if you don't mind me saying,

2415
01:49:32,076 --> 01:49:33,509
you need it.

2416
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:35,745
Someone may come in
with more experience than you,

2417
01:49:35,746 --> 01:49:38,715
but they're never gonna know
what you know.

2418
01:49:38,716 --> 01:49:41,050
I never had anything like this
in my life.

2419
01:49:41,051 --> 01:49:42,819
Not many people do.

2420
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:46,790
This big, beautiful,
exciting thing that you created.

2421
01:49:46,791 --> 01:49:49,158
It's a dream,
isn't it?

2422
01:49:49,159 --> 01:49:50,660
And you're gonna
give that up

2423
01:49:50,661 --> 01:49:54,130
in the hopes that your husband
will stop having an affair?

2424
01:49:54,131 --> 01:49:56,699
I don't see
how that adds up.

2425
01:49:56,700 --> 01:49:59,802
You should feel nothing but
great about what you've done.

2426
01:49:59,803 --> 01:50:03,474
And I'd hate to see you let
anyone take that away from you.

2427
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:10,447
I guess
you came over here

2428
01:50:10,448 --> 01:50:13,416
because you wanted to hear
some of this.

2429
01:50:13,417 --> 01:50:15,017
Yes.

2430
01:50:15,018 --> 01:50:17,720
And maybe also
because you're my...

2431
01:50:17,721 --> 01:50:19,123
Intern.

2432
01:50:20,491 --> 01:50:25,196
Well, I was gonna say
intern/best friend.

2433
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:28,765
But there's no need to get
all sentimental about it

2434
01:50:28,766 --> 01:50:31,534
even though we could potentially
be buried together.

2435
01:50:31,535 --> 01:50:33,569
Can't get closer
than that.

2436
01:50:37,308 --> 01:50:38,641
It's Moments like this
when you need

2437
01:50:38,642 --> 01:50:40,676
someone you know
you can count on.

2438
01:50:40,677 --> 01:50:42,146
So thank you.

2439
01:50:45,116 --> 01:50:47,617
I like your house
so much by the way.

2440
01:50:47,618 --> 01:50:49,454
Thanks.

2441
01:50:53,891 --> 01:50:55,693
So?

2442
01:51:10,841 --> 01:51:12,675
Shall we?

2443
01:51:12,676 --> 01:51:14,412
Okay.

2444
01:51:20,117 --> 01:51:22,352
Welcome back,
you two.

2445
01:51:22,353 --> 01:51:24,053
Jules, I have something cool
to show you.

2446
01:51:24,054 --> 01:51:25,955
Do you remember taking
a customer-service call

2447
01:51:25,956 --> 01:51:28,758
about a bride whose bridesmaids'
dresses showed up in gray,

2448
01:51:28,759 --> 01:51:30,226
and we had the vendor
remake them overnight

2449
01:51:30,227 --> 01:51:31,428
and put them on a plane?

2450
01:51:31,429 --> 01:51:33,229
Yeah. Yeah.
Rachel.

2451
01:51:33,230 --> 01:51:34,965
Check this out.

2452
01:51:36,734 --> 01:51:38,901
The silk Chiffon
Antoinette dress.

2453
01:51:38,902 --> 01:51:41,304
They look beautiful.

2454
01:51:41,305 --> 01:51:44,408
Oh, and these just arrived
from Mark Townsend.

2455
01:51:46,711 --> 01:51:48,246
- Here.
- Thanks.

2456
01:51:58,555 --> 01:52:00,690
Becky? Give me Townsend's
number, will you?

2457
01:52:00,691 --> 01:52:02,458
Okay.

2458
01:52:04,762 --> 01:52:06,162
This is Jules.

2459
01:52:06,163 --> 01:52:08,264
Hey, Alonzo, what's up?

2460
01:52:08,265 --> 01:52:09,865
Uh-huh. Okay.

2461
01:52:09,866 --> 01:52:12,503
Do we need that many?

2462
01:52:18,142 --> 01:52:20,143
I hope I'm not too late.

2463
01:52:20,144 --> 01:52:21,945
Don't do this for me,
Jules.

2464
01:52:21,946 --> 01:52:23,079
Please?

2465
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:25,048
Just do what feels right
for you.

2466
01:52:25,049 --> 01:52:26,951
Oh, my God.

2467
01:52:29,519 --> 01:52:32,522
I want to continue running
my company, Matt.

2468
01:52:32,523 --> 01:52:33,956
You got to know that.

2469
01:52:33,957 --> 01:52:36,959
Then do it.
I don't want you to be unhappy.

2470
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,564
I'm already unhappy.

2471
01:52:42,099 --> 01:52:43,666
I need to
tell you something.

2472
01:52:43,667 --> 01:52:45,369
I know.

2473
01:52:46,303 --> 01:52:48,371
Just tell me,
is it almost over?

2474
01:52:48,372 --> 01:52:50,306
I don't know
how much longer I can...

2475
01:52:50,307 --> 01:52:52,541
it's over.

2476
01:52:52,542 --> 01:52:57,580
I can't tell you
how s-sorry and ashamed I am.

2477
01:52:57,581 --> 01:53:00,516
I thought
I could do it.

2478
01:53:00,517 --> 01:53:02,786
I thought I could be
the guy that I told you

2479
01:53:02,787 --> 01:53:04,820
I was going to be.

2480
01:53:04,821 --> 01:53:08,392
And then
somewhere along the way...

2481
01:53:10,227 --> 01:53:12,230
...I thought
I was losing you.

2482
01:53:14,298 --> 01:53:17,834
But it was actually me.

2483
01:53:17,835 --> 01:53:19,602
I got lost.

2484
01:53:19,603 --> 01:53:21,538
It's a confusing world
out there,

2485
01:53:21,539 --> 01:53:24,341
and who I am
got messed up for a minute.

2486
01:53:24,342 --> 01:53:30,380
And now I'm watching you ready
to give all this up for me.

2487
01:53:30,381 --> 01:53:33,650
I will not
let that happen.

2488
01:53:33,651 --> 01:53:38,788
I love you, and I will do so
much better if you'll let me.

2489
01:53:44,361 --> 01:53:46,295
Please, Jules.

2490
01:53:46,296 --> 01:53:49,867
Let me
make it right again.

2491
01:53:59,543 --> 01:54:01,712
You know
what would be good?

2492
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:05,416
If you carried
a handkerchief.

2493
01:54:19,696 --> 01:54:22,298
Have you
called Townsend yet?

2494
01:54:22,299 --> 01:54:25,135
Because if I've ever met anyone
who doesn't need a Boss,

2495
01:54:25,136 --> 01:54:26,804
it was you.

2496
01:54:28,338 --> 01:54:31,809
I was just about to call him
and tell him I changed my mind.

2497
01:54:33,343 --> 01:54:35,311
I mean,
we're good here.

2498
01:54:35,312 --> 01:54:37,547
We're gonna make it.

2499
01:54:37,548 --> 01:54:39,115
I'm gonna make sure
we make it.

2500
01:54:39,116 --> 01:54:40,850
Good.

2501
01:55:03,474 --> 01:55:05,007
Becky.

2502
01:55:05,008 --> 01:55:06,442
Where's Ben?

2503
01:55:06,443 --> 01:55:09,880
I'm not sure. He said
he was taking the day off.

2504
01:55:14,785 --> 01:55:16,519
Fiona.

2505
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:18,254
Do you know
where Ben is?

2506
01:55:51,121 --> 01:55:52,522
I'm so sorry
to interrupt.

2507
01:55:52,523 --> 01:55:54,957
That's okay.

2508
01:55:54,958 --> 01:55:58,027
Extend your left arm,
Jules.

2509
01:55:58,028 --> 01:56:00,663
Left knee up...

2510
01:56:00,664 --> 01:56:04,701
Breathe and relax
for inner balance.

2511
01:56:04,702 --> 01:56:07,470
- Am I doing it right?
- Almost.

2512
01:56:07,471 --> 01:56:08,905
Got something good
to tell you.

2513
01:56:08,906 --> 01:56:10,975
Great.
Tell me when we're done.

2514
01:56:14,578 --> 01:56:17,515
Breathe deeply, Jules.

2515
01:56:22,453 --> 01:56:24,587
That's it, out there.

2516
01:56:24,588 --> 01:56:27,023
This up.
